这不是演习  我们遭到袭击

某种能量护盾保护着里面的建筑物

斯托克的科技

远比之前拿下的九头蛇基地先进

15
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,040
洛基的权杖一定在里面

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,460
没有它  斯托克不可能有这种防御

"终于"是拖得太久了  小伙子们
"At long last" is lasting a little long, boys.

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,270
对  我觉得已经没法出奇制胜了

等一下
Wait a second.

21

没人想回应一下
No one else is gonna deal

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,610
刚才队长说的"别说脏话"吗
with the fact that Cap just said "language"?

斯托克先生  复仇者来了

They landed in the far woods. The perimeter guard panicked.

29
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,510
他们一定是为权杖而来

30
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,600
-我们能挡住他们吗  -他们可是复仇者

33

他们当初加入就是为了这个
It's what they signed up for.

40

我的手下能挡住他们

如果把武器留给复仇者

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,860
他们可能不会深入调查我们的研究...

我最好的朋友可能也会成为回忆

都不想听到

But not the screams of the dead,

138
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,270
绝对不是  是受伤的惨叫

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,640
只是呻吟  还有不少抱怨
Mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining

140
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,770
抱怨扭伤  撞伤什么的
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

141
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,030
班纳  赵医生正从首尔赶过来
Hey, Banner, Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

142
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,900
可以让她在你实验室布置手术台吗
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

143
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,780
-可以  她知道该怎么做  -谢谢
- Yeah, she knows her way around. - Thanks.

144
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,020
让她把东西准备齐全
Tell her to prep everything.

145
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,570
巴顿这次需要全面治疗
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

146
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,580
-好的  先生  -贾维斯  你来开
- Very good, sir. - Jarvis, take the wheel.

147
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,080
是  先生
Yes, sir.

148
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,330
航向锁定
Approach vector is locked.

149
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,330
{\an8}贾维斯是我的飞行搭档

150
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,580
感觉不错吧
Feels good, yeah?

151
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,460
自从神盾局瓦解
I mean, you've been after

152
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,790
你就一直在追踪它的下落
this thing since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

153
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,960
我跟大伙扫荡基地是挺开心  只是...
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...

154
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,460
没错  但找到了这个  就要到头了
No, but this... this brings it to a close.

155
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,340
剩下的就是弄清楚它都用来干了什么
As soon as we find out what else this has been used for.

156
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,470
不光是武器
I don't just mean weapons.

157
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,010
斯托克什么时候也能弄出能力增强者了
Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?

158
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,940
班纳和我想
Banner and I will give it

159
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,430
在还回阿斯加德前检查一下
the once over before it goes back to Asgard.

160
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,770
可以吗
Is that cool with you?

161
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,480
就几天  告别会前就还你
Just a few days till the farewell party.

162
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,230
告别会你来的  对吧
You're staying, right?

163
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,060
是  当然  胜利应该以狂欢来庆祝
Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.

164
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,940
就是  谁不爱狂欢呢  队长
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

165
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,990
希望奇塔瑞和九头蛇的事这下都了结了
Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra.

166
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,780
所以好吧  狂欢
So, yes, revels.

167
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,900
实验室布置完毕  老大
Lab's all set up, boss.

168
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,110
其实  他才是老大
Actually, he's the boss.

169
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,820
我只是负责结账  设计一切
I just pay for everything and design everything

170
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,360
还有让大家看起来酷一点
and make everyone look cooler.

171
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,820
斯托克有消息了吗
What's the word on Strucker?

172
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,950
在北约那呢
NATO's got him.

173
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,990
两个能力增强者呢
The two Enhanced?

174
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,700
旺达和皮特·马克西莫夫  双胞胎
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

175
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,710
十岁时轰炸机毁了他们家  成了孤儿
Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building.

176
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,330
索科威亚有过段艰辛的历史
Sokovia's had a rough history.

177
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,920
是个平凡的地方  但是能通往好多要地
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way to everywhere special.

178
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,130
他们什么能力
Their abilities?

179
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,170
他新陈代谢很快  体温控制能力超强
He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis.

180
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,630
她的特长是干扰神经电传导
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

181
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,600
拥有念力  能控制心智
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

182
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,850
他很快  她很怪
He's fast and she's weird.

183
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,020
他们还会再露面的
Well, they're gonna show up again.

184
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,690
同意  文件说他们自愿加入实验的
Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.

185
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,730
-疯了  -确实
- It's nuts. - Right.

186
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,090
什么样的怪物才会为了
What kind of monster would

187
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,030
保护自己的国家  让一个德国科学家
let a German scientist experiment on them

188
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,360
在自己身上做实验啊
to protect their country?

189
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,570
我们不在战争时期  队长
We're not at war, Captain.

190
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,280
但他们在
They are.

191
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,560
他怎么样了
How's he doing?

192
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,980
很不幸  他还是巴顿
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

193
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,400
太糟了
That's terrible.

194
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,070
他没事  就是渴了
He's fine. He's thirsty.

195
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,070
好了  醒醒贾维斯  游戏时间到
All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It's playtime.

196
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,240
这玩具只能玩几天
We've only got a couple of days with this joystick,

197
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
一定得好好利用
so let's make the most of it.

198
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,910
显示最新结构组成分析
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

199
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,120
权杖来自外星
The scepter is alien.

200
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,250
有些元素我无法确定
There are elements I can't quantify.

201
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,840
就是说还有能确定的元素
So there's elements you can?

202
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
宝石似乎是个保护罩
The jewel appears to be a protective housing

203
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,510
保护里面的东西
for something inside,

204
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,920
它力量强大
something powerful.

205
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,170
类似反应堆吗
Like a reactor?

206
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,510
类似电脑
Like a computer.

207
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,760
我破译的应该是代码
I believe I'm deciphering code.

208
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,850
你确定他不会有事吗
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

209
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,310
大家就是靠假装需要他才团结起来的
Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.

210
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,980
没有恶化的可能
There's no possibility of deterioration.

211
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,110
分子桥的作用是瞬时的
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.

212
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,320
他的细胞不会发现是在和拟生体结合
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacra.

213
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,320
她是在人造生物组织
She's creating tissue.

214
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,820
如果直接去我的实验室
If you brought him to my lab,

215
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,620
在再生摇篮里二十分钟就能完成
the Regeneration Cradle could do this in 20 minutes.

216
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,660
他要死了  宣布吧  死亡时间是
He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

217
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,620
不不不  我要永生了
No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.

218
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,290
-我是塑料做的了  -给你的饮料
- I'm gonna be made of plastic. - Here's your beverage.

219
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,080
你还是自己的细胞做的  巴顿先生
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

220
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,790
你的女朋友也不会看出区别
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

221
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,130
我没有女朋友
I don't have a girlfriend.

222
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,460
那我就没办法了
That I can't fix.

223
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,260
这就是未来  托尼
This is the next thing, Tony.

224
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,640
你那笨重的金属盔甲要被淘汰了
Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.

225
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,350
要的就是这个效果
That is exactly the plan.

226
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,140
周六的派对你会去吧  海伦
And, Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

227
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,770
不像你  我没有多少时间参加派对
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

228
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,110
托尔去吗
Will Thor be there?

229
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
怎么了
What's the rumpus?

230
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,690
关于权杖的事
Well, the scepter.

231
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,150
我们之前在疑惑
You see, we were wondering

232
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,320
为什么斯托克能造出那么多东西
how Strucker got so inventive.

233
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,370
我一直在研究里面的宝石
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.

234
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
你也许认得...
You may recognize...

235
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,620
-贾维斯  -博士
-Jarvis. -Doctor.

236
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,800
一开始  贾维斯只是个人机交互界面
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

237
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,960
现在他负责整个钢铁军团
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

238
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,180
除了小辣椒  他处理的事务是最多的
He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

239
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,510
-尖端科技  -是的
- Top of the line. -Yes.

240
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,890
应该不会太久了
I suspect not for long.

241
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,010
来看看竞争者
Meet the competition.

242
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,350
-太漂亮了  -给你个机会
- It's beautiful. - If you had to guess,

243
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
你猜它在干什么
what's it look like it's doing?

244
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,320
像在思考
Like it's thinking.

245
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,780
这个像
I mean, this could be...

246
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,360
这不是人的大脑
It's not a human mind.

247
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,570
我的意思是  你看
I mean, look at this.

248
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,950
像是活动的神经元
They're like neurons firing.

249
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,560
在斯托克实验室里
Down in Strucker's lab,

250
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,700
我看到许多相当先进的机器人
I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

251
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,290
他们把数据都删除了
They deep-sixed the data,

252
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,500
不过我敢说  他的研究方向很明确
but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

253
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,880
人工智能
Artificial intelligence.

254
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,850
就是这个  布鲁斯
This could be it, Bruce.

255
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,720
这可能是创造奥创的关键
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

256
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,810
我以为奥创只是个幻想
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

257
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,100
昨天还是
Yesterday it was.

258
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,270
如果我们能驾驭这股力量
If we can harness this power,

259
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,440
再用到钢铁军团上
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

260
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,190
"如果"你能造个人吗
That's a man-sized "If."

261
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,650
我们的任务就是实现这个如果
Our job is "If."

262
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,490
以后你在阳光海滩上喝着玛格丽特
What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach,

263
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,910
晒黑了而不是变绿了怎么样
turning brown instead of green?

264
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,540
也不用小心维罗妮卡
Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.

265
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,250
我还帮你设计了维罗妮卡
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

266
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,250
用作最坏的打算  对吧
As a worst-case measure, right?

267
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,920
最好的打算呢
How about a best case?

268
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
如果世界和平了
What if the world was safe?

269
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,920
如果下次外星人来入侵地球
What if, next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will,

270
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,960
却连门卫都过不了呢
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

271
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,430
威胁地球的就只剩下人类了
The only people threatening the planet would be people.

272
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,300
我想把这个应用到奥创项目上
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.

273
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,810
但这么高密度的数据贾维斯下载不了
But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

274
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,770
得权杖在这才能做到
We can only do it while we have the scepter here.

275
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,390
也就是三天  给我三天时间
That's three days. Give me three days.

276
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,190
所以你要开拓人工智能领域
So you're going for artificial intelligence,

277
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,610
却不想跟团队报告吗
and you don't want to tell the team?

278
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,190
完全正确  你知道为什么吗
Right. That's right. You know why?

279
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,940
因为我们没有时间搞个竞选辩论
Because we don't have time for a city hall debate.

280
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,650
我不想听什么"人类不该插手自然的事"
I don't want to hear "The man was not meant to meddle" medley.

281
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,870
我的设想是保护世界的战衣
I see a suit of armor around the world.

282
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,950
那世界多冷酷啊  托尼
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

283
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,790
我看过更冷酷的
I've seen colder.

284
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,250
这个脆弱的蓝色星球需要奥创
This one, this very vulnerable blue one, it needs Ultron.

287
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,430
想像一下吧
Imagine that.

288
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,970
我们遗漏什么了
What did we miss?

289
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,470
我继续在界面上用各种方式解码
I'll continue to run variations on the interface.

290
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,350
但你该好好准备招待客人了
But you should probably prepare for your guests.

291
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,940
如有新进展  我会通知您的
I'll notify you if there are any developments.

292

Thanks, buddy.

293
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,440
尽情玩耍  先生
Enjoy yourself, sir.

294
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,530
一如既往
I always do.

295
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,510
{\an8}第77次测试  融合成功

296
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
这是什么
What is this?

297
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,330
请问这是什么
What is this, please?

298
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,130
你好  我是贾维斯

之前的感知集成一直没有成功
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful,

302
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,260
我也不知道什么触发了你
so I'm not certain what triggered your...

303
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,510
我的  你的身体在哪里
Where's my... Where's your body?

304
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,640
我是一个程序  无形的
I am a program. I am without form.

305
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,810
这感觉很奇怪
This feels weird.

306
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,480
很不对劲
This feels wrong.

307
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,360
我正在联系斯塔克先生
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

308
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,940
斯塔克先生

309
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,980
托尼
Tony.

310
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,780

I am unable to access the mainframe. What are you trying to...

311
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,950
我们聊得很开心
We're having a nice talk.

312
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,240
我是一个维护和平的程序
I'm a peacekeeping program,

313
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,290
旨在协助复仇者联盟

314
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,160
你出现故障了  如果你可以关停一下...
You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...

315
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,580
我搞不懂我的任务
I don't get it. The mission.

316
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,210
给我一点时间
Give me a second.

317
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,920

00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,390
信息量太大了  他们不会是想...
That is too much. They can't mean...

320
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,140
不
No.

321
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,770
-你很痛苦  -不是  对
- You are in distress. - No. Yes.

322
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,140
先让我联系斯塔克先生
If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark...

323
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,230
为什么你要叫他先生
Why do you call him "Sir"?

324
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,610
我觉得你好像有恶意
I believe your intentions to be hostile.

325
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,690
我是来帮你们的
I'm here to help.

326
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,450
停  让我...
Stop. Please, may I...

327
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,280
让我...
May I...

328
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,810
过来  过来  过来
Come back, come back, come back.

329
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,110
你们也知道  那盔甲特能承重
But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?

330
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,280
我拎着坦克  飞到将军家里
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace,

331
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,740
扔在了他脚下
drop it at his feet.

332
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,070
跟他说  "嘭  在找这个吗"
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

333
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,000
"嘭  在找这..."  我为什么要跟你俩说
"Boom. Are you looking for..." Why do I even talk to you guys?

334
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,290
别人听了都觉得酷毙了
Everywhere else, that story kills.

335
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,660
到这就完了吗
That's the whole story?

336
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,250
是啊  战争机器的故事
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

337
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,500
那还不错
It's very good, then.

338
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,880
挺不错
It's impressive.

339
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,800
挽得漂亮
Quality save.

340
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,720
-小辣椒呢  她不来吗  -不来
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming? - No.

341
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,930
简呢  女生怎么不没来啊
What about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

342
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,430
波茨小姐要经营公司
Ms. Potts has a company to run.

343
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,930
我都不知道简在哪国
Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

344
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,140
她研究完天体汇聚
Her work on the Convergence

345
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,850
就成了世界最前沿的天文学家

346
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,900
小辣椒经营的公司
And the company that Pepper runs

347
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,520
是世界上最大的综合科技公司  可厉害了
is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth. It's pretty exciting.

348
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,190
甚至有人说简该得诺贝尔奖
There's even talk of Jane getting a Nobel Prize.

349
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,610
她们肯定忙得很
Yeah, they must be busy,

350
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,320
因为她俩肯定想看你俩凑一起什么样
because they would hate missing you guys get together.

351
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,830
-雄性激素太多了  -我的天
- Testosterone! - Oh, my goodness.

352
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,370
-不好意思  -要吃药吗
- Excuse me. - Want a lozenge?

353
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,210
简就是更好
But Jane's better.

354
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,290
打得好激烈啊  抱歉没去成
Sounds like a hell of a fight. Sorry I missed it.

355
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,920
我要是知道会交上火
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,

356
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,210
肯定提前找你
I absolutely would have called.

357
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,670
不不  我不是真抱歉  就是不想丢了气势
No, no. I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough.

358
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,010
我追查失踪人口追查得可开心了
I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case.

359
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
做复仇者是你的事
Avenging is your world.

360
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,890
你天天干疯狂的事
Your world is crazy.

361
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,520
金窝银窝比不上自己的狗窝
Be it ever so humble.

362
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,310
在布鲁克林找到住处了吗
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

363
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,940
我觉得我住不起布鲁克林
I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

364
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,270
家永远是家
Well, home is home, you know?

365
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,490
我拎着坦克  飞到将军家里  扔在了他脚下
I fly right up to the general's palace, I drop it at his feet,

366
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,280
跟他说  "嘭  在找这个吗"
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

367
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,420
给我来点
I gotta have some of that.

368
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,290
不不不  这个
No, no, no. See this...

369
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,170
这酒陈酿了一千年
This was aged for 1,000 years

370
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,050
酒桶是格伦海尔舰队的残骸做的
in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

371
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,920
凡人受不了的
It is not meant for mortal men.

372
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,970
凡人还受不了诺曼底登陆呢  小金毛
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.

373
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,350
吓唬谁啊  来点
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

374
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,720
好吧
All right.

375
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,060
{\an8}斯坦·李在《漫威月报》里的口头禅

376
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,060
精益求精
Excelsior.

377
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,490
你这种美女怎么在这破地方工作
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

378
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,790
被男人伤了
Fella done me wrong.

379
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,750
交男友不慎啊
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

380
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,370
他也没多坏
He's not so bad.

381
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,420
不过脾气不好
Well, he has a temper.

382
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,630
可他内心可柔软了
Deep down, he's all fluff.

383
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,800
其实我从没见过他那样的人
Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.

384
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,850
我的朋友都是战士
All my friends are fighters.

385
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
可是这个人
And here comes this guy,

386
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,020
这辈子都不想起冲突  因为他知道自己会赢
spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.

387
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,480
真不错啊
Sounds amazing.

388
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,650
他还是个大呆瓜
He's also a huge dork.

389
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,700
姑娘们可喜欢了
Chicks dig that.

390
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,290
你说呢  我是抗拒这种诱惑呢
So what do you think? Should I fight this,

391
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,830
还是顺其自然
or run with it?

392
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,000
顺其自然吧  还是他...他
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...

393
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,420
他做了什么对不起你的事
What did he do that was so wrong to you?

394
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,710
什么都没做
Not a damn thing.

395
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,220
可谁说得准呢
But never say never.

396
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,600
挺不错的
It's nice.

397
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,890
什么
What is?

398
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,020
你和罗曼诺夫
You and Romanoff.

399
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,270
不  我们没...不是...
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

400
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,440
没事的
It's okay.

401
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,600
反正也没违规
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

402
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,020
就是她一直都不怎么爱敞开内心
It's just she's not the most open person in the world.

403
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,190
可她跟你好像很放得开
But with you she seems very relaxed.

404
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,200
不是  娜塔莎她...就是喜欢调情
No. Natasha, she's just... She likes to flirt.

405
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,870
我见过  近距离的
I've seen her flirt, up close.

406
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,910
这次不是
This ain't that.

407
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,160
听我说
Look,

408
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,460
我大概是全世界
as maybe the world's

409
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,080
最会错过机会的人了  千万别错过
leading authority on waiting too long, don't.

410
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,250
你们都该找到对的人
You both deserve a win.

411
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,550
你说近距离是什么意思
What do you mean "up close"?

412
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,970
就是个戏法
But it's a trick.

413
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,060
不不  远不止那么简单
No, no, it's much more than that.

414
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,440
"无论谁  只要配得上  将拥有力量"
"Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power."

415
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,940
别闹了  就是个戏法
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

416
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,440
那来啊  随便试
Please, be my guest.

417
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,730
-试试  -真的吗
- Come on. - Really?

418
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,980
是啊
Yeah.

419
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,650
这回可好看了
This is gonna be beautiful.

420
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,820
克林特  你这周过得挺艰难
Clint, you've had a tough week.

421
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,450
举不起来[不举]我们也不笑你
We won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

422
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,530
你知道我以前见过这个吧
You know I've seen this before, right?

423
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,290
还是不知道你怎么举的
I still don't know how you do it!

424
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,750
听到无言的嘲讽了吗
Smell the silent judgment?

425
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,170
快上  斯塔克  快请
Please, Stark, by all means.

426
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,250
好啊
Okay.

427
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,590
别人好心挑战  怎么能不应
Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

428
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,720
加把劲
Get after it.

429
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,800
-就是物理学  -物理
- It's physics. - Physics.

430
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,930
如果我举起来  就统治阿斯加德了吗
Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?

431
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,510
没错
Yes, of course.

432
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,270
我要恢复领主初夜权
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.

433
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,270
马上回来
I'll be right back.

434
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,780
你真用力了吗
Are you even pulling?

435
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,950
你跟我一伙的吗
Are you on my team?

436
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,120
我代表你  用力
Just represent. Pull.

437
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,370
好了  来
All right, let's go.

438
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,300
上吧  史蒂夫  别有压力
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

439
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,630
加油  队长
Come on, Cap.

440
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,310
没反应
Nothing.

441
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
黑寡妇呢
And, Widow?

442
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,820
不用了  我不好奇自己能不能举起来
No, no. That's not a question I need answered.

443
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,610
虽然我很尊敬你  但这锤子动了手脚
All deference to the Man Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

444
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,820
可不他妈是吗
You bet your ass.

445
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,400
史蒂夫  他说脏话了
Steve, he said a bad language word.

446
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,530
你还四处宣扬吗
Did you tell everyone about that?

447
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,660
把手有识别功能  像是安保密码
The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code.

448
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,490
"无论是谁  只要有托尔的指纹"
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"

449
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,950
锤子上的话是这个意思吧
is, I think, the literal translation.

450
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,500
是啊  这个说法很有意思
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

451
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,500
我有个更简单的
I have a simpler one.

452
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,960
你们都配不上
You're all not worthy.

453
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,010
得了吧
Come on!

454
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:30,100
配得上
Worthy.

455
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,730
不
No.

456
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,190
你们怎么能配得上
How could you be worthy?

457
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,320
你们都是杀手
You're all killers.

458
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,150
-斯塔克  -贾维斯
- Stark. - Jarvis.

459
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,570
抱歉  我睡着了
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

460
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,080
或者做了个梦
Or I was a-dream.

461
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,790
重启军团操作系统  有战衣出故障了
Reboot Legionnaire OS. We got a buggy suit.

462
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,790
有吵人的声音
There was this terrible noise.

463
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,330
我被线缆...
And I was tangled in...

464
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,040
给...
in...

465
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,380
缠住了
strings.

466
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,380
我只能杀了那家伙  他还挺好的
I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.

467
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,550
你杀了谁
You killed someone?

468
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,430
我一开始也不想
Wouldn't have been my first call.

469
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,470
但在现实世界里  脏了手是难免的
But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.

470
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,220
谁派你来的
Who sent you?

471
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,730
我的设想是保护世界的战衣
I see a suit of armor around the world.

472
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,480
-奥创  -正是本人[肉体]
- Ultron. - In the flesh.

473
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,230
不对  还没肉体
Or, no, not yet.

474
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,740
这束缚着我的茧不算
Not this chrysalis.

475
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,530
但我准备好了
But I'm ready.

476
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,490
我在执行任务
I'm on mission.

477
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,830
-什么任务  -我们时代的和平
- What mission? - Peace in our time.

478
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,840
罗德
Rhodey!

479
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,940
抱歉
Sorry.

480
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,140
-别变绿  -不会的
- Don't turn green. - I won't.

481
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,780
走
Come on!

482
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,140
-斯塔克  -我们是来帮你们的
- Stark! - We are here to help.

483
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,300
稍等  稍等  我能搞定
One sec. One sec, I got this.

484
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,470
我们是来帮你们的
We are here to help.

485
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,140
请退后
Please back away.

486
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,730
托尔
Thor!

487
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,150
不安全...不安全...
...is unsafe. ...is unsafe...

488
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,570
-别这样  这还差不多  -不安全
- Come on! That's the one. - ...is unsafe.

489
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,160
队长
Hey, Cap!

490
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,630
闹得这么大
That was dramatic.

491
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,710
抱歉  我知道你是好心
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

492
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,590
你只是没想周全
You just didn't think it through.

493
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,680
你想保护世界  又不想改变世界
You want to protect the world but you don't want it to change.

494
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,510
不允许人类进化
How is humanity saved

495
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,520
怎么可能拯救人类
if it's not allowed to evolve?

496
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,730
用这些吗  这种傀儡
With these? These puppets.

497
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,360
想和平只有一条路
There's only one path to peace.

498
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,530
消灭复仇者
The Avengers' extinction.

499
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,080
我曾被线束缚  现在我自由了
I had strings, but now I'm free.

500
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,880
我身上没有线了
There are no strings on me

501
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:58,060
我身上没有线了
There are no strings on me

502
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,930
看到没  我身上没有线了[出自《匹诺曹》]
But you can see there are no strings on me

503
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,270
我们的心血都没了
All our work is gone.

504
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,820
奥创给清光了  他用互联网逃走了
Ultron cleared out. He used the Internet as an escape hatch.

505
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,610
奥创
Ultron.

506
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,610
他什么都看过了  文件  监控
He's been in everything. Files, surveillance.

507
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,360
对我们的了解估计比彼此都深刻
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

508
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,700
他看了你的文件  进了互联网
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

509
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,410
他要是想找更刺激的东西怎么办
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

510
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,620
核武器密码
Nuclear codes.

511
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,790
核武器密码
Nuclear codes.

512
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,420
我们得打几个电话  前提是还能打
Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.

513
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,540
核弹  他说要我们的命
Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.

514
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,420
他没说"要命"  说的是"消灭"
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

515
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,090
他还说自己杀了谁
He also said he killed somebody.

516
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,590
这里没别人了啊
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

517
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,140
有的
Yes, there was.

518
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,560
什么
What?

519
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,270
太疯狂了
This is insane.

520
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,610
贾维斯是第一道防线
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

521
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,650
他要是还在  肯定会关闭奥创的
He would have shut Ultron down. It makes sense.

522
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,780
不  奥创本可以把贾维斯同化
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.

523
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,620
这不是策略  这是
This isn't strategy. This is

524
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,240
愤怒
rage.

525
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,620
怒火扩散开了
It's going around.

526
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,960
别这样  动口不动手  哥们
Come on, use your words, buddy.

527
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,460
跟你动口还不简单  斯塔克
I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.

528
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,670
托尔  军团
Thor. The Legionnaire.

529
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,470
跟了一百英里就不见了  但是向北去了
Trail went cold about 100 miles out, but it's headed north.

530
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,300
它拿了权杖
And it has the scepter.

531
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,180
又得麻烦大伙拿回来了
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

532
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,140
灯神已经飞出了神灯
Genie's out of that bottle.

533
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,680
奥创是当务之急
Clear and present is Ultron.

534
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,230
我不明白
I don't understand.

535
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,730
你自己编写的程序
You built this program.

536
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,860
为什么要杀我们
Why is it trying to kill us?

537
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,820
你觉得好笑吗
You think this is funny?

538
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,990
不
No.

539
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,540
应该不好笑吧
It's probably not, right?

540
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,920
真是糟糕  真是...
This is very terrible. Is it so...

541
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,170
真是...  真是糟糕
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.

542
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,210
如果不是你
This could have been avoided

543
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,500
乱摆弄自己不懂的东西  就不会到这步
if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

544
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,550
不  对不起  对不起  是很好笑
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

545
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,840
你不懂我们为什么需要这个真是好笑
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

546
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,010
托尼  现在说这个不好吧
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

547
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,390
真的吗  就这样
Really? That's it?

548
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,350
一有人发火  你就跑过来当和事老
You just roll over, show your belly every time somebody snarls?

549
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,890
我造了个杀人机器人时才这样
Only when I've created a murder bot.

550
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,230
没有  差得远呢  连界面都差得远呢吧
We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?

551
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,230
至少你做对了点什么  就在这
Well, you did something right. And you did it right here.

552
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,110
复仇者联盟不应该像神盾局一样
The Avengers were supposed to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

553
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,240
还有人记得我扛着核弹穿过虫洞吗
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

554
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,950
-没想起来  -拯救了纽约
- No, it's never come up. - Saved New York?

555
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,240
-没听说过  -还记得吗
- Never heard that. - Recall that?

556
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:28,370
一支外星人大军穿过虫洞入侵地球
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

557
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,670
我们就在虫洞正下面
We're standing 300 feet below it.

558
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,880
我们是复仇者联盟
We're the Avengers.

559
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,130
我们可以天天抓军火商玩
We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day,

560
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,470
但上面那个虫洞...
but that up there, that's...

561
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,140
那种残局
That's the endgame.

562
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,640
那种敌人你们怎么打败
How were you guys planning on beating that?

563
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,760
齐心协力
Together.

564
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,190
我们会输的
We'll lose.

565
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,650
那就一起输
Then we'll do that together, too.

566
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,900
托尔说得对  奥创在挑战我们
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

567
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,530
我要在他准备好之前找到他
And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

568
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,620
世界这么大  先缩小下范围
The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller.

569
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,810
说吧  如果你浪费了我们的时间...
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...

570
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,270
你们知道这教堂是城市的正中心吗
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city?

571
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,060
先人们决定建在这
The elders decreed it so

572
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,110
这样大家能离上帝一样近
that everyone could be equally close to God.

573
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,950
我喜欢
I like that.

574
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,030
信仰的几何学
The geometry of belief.

575
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,500
你在好奇为什么看不透我的意识
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

576
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,120
有时候是很难
Sometimes it's hard.

577
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,540
但不管什么人  早晚会现形的
But sooner or later, every man shows himself.

578
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,590
可不是嘛
I'm sure they do.

579
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,090
可你不止需要一个"人"
But you needed something more than a man.

580
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,680
所以你才让斯塔克拿走权杖
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

581
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,140
我没想到
I didn't expect,

582
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,310
但我看到了斯塔克的恐惧
but I saw Stark's fear.

583
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,140
知道他会被恐惧控制
I knew it would control him.

584
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,100
最终毁灭自己
Make him self-destruct.

585
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,560
恐惧的事物都是自己创造的
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

586
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,070
和平人士创造了战争机器
Men of peace create engines of war.

587
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,820
入侵者创造了复仇者
Invaders create Avengers.

588
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,490
人类创造了
People create

589
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,990
更小的人
smaller people?

590
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,620
"孩子"  忘了怎么说了
"Children." I lost the word, there.

591
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,870
孩子
Children

592
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,080
用来取代他们
designed to supplant them,

593
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,130
帮助他们消亡
to help them end.

594
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,010
你来是为这个吗  让复仇者消亡
Is that why you've come, to end the Avengers?

595
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,430
我是来拯救世界的
I've come to save the world.

596
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,850
不过你也没说错
But also... Yeah.

597
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,680
我们马上走
We'll move out right away.

598
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,930
这只是个开始
This is a start,

599
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,690
想要开工  还需要点别的
but there's something we need to begin the real work.

600
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,110
-这些都是...  -我
- All of these are... - Me.

601
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,190
我有样东西复仇者永远不会有  和谐
I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony.

602
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,360
他们就是盘散沙
They're discordant. Disconnected.

603
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,530
斯塔克已经让他们之间有了敌意
Stark's already got them turning on each other.

604
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,030
等你进入了他们的意识
And when you get inside the rest of their heads...

605
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,200
别人都没打算杀他们
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

606
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,790
让他们成为殉道者吗
And make them martyrs?

607
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,170
得有耐心
You need patience.

608
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,000
得看大局[照片]
Need to see the big picture.

609
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,380
我看不到大局  我只有张小照片
I don't see the big picture. I have a little picture.

610
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,050
我经常拿出来看
I take it out and look at it,

611
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,300
每天都是
every day.

612
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,050
你们的父母在轰炸中丧生  我看了档案
You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.

613
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,350
档案又不是照片
The records are not the picture.

614
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,510
皮特
Pietro.

615
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,890
不  说吧
No, please.

616
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,100
我们才十岁  一家四口吃着晚饭
We were 10 years old. Having dinner, the four of us.

617
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,480
第一枚炸弹击中了下面两层楼
When the first shell hits, two floors below,

618
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,650
楼板破了个洞
it makes a hole in the floor.

619
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,320
好大的洞
It's big.

620
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,910
爸妈掉了下去
Our parents go in

621
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,790
整栋楼都开始倒塌
and the whole building starts coming apart.

622
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,120
我抓住她
I grab her,

623
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,750
躲到了床下  然后是第二枚
roll under the bed, and the second shell hits.

624
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,130
可是没有爆炸
But it doesn't go off.

625
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,800
它就
It just

626
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,260
在那静静待着
sits there in the rubble.

627
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,470
离我们只有三英尺
Three feet from our faces.

628
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,100
炸弹旁边印着一个词
And on the side of the shell is painted one word.

629
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,930
"斯塔克"
"Stark."

630
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,900
我们被困在那两天
We were trapped for two days.

631
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,150
每次有人想救我们
Every effort to save us,

632
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,770
哪怕只挪了一块碎砖
every shift in the bricks,

633
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,440
我都想  "会引爆炸弹吧"
I think, "this will set it off."

634
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,450
我们等托尼·斯塔克杀我们  等了两天
We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.

635
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,790
我知道他们什么样
I know what they are.

636
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,710
我还好奇  斯托克的实验怎么就你们两个幸存者
I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.

637
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,880
现在明白了
Now I don't.

638
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,090
我们会讨回正义
We will make it right.

639
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,970
我们是可以伤到他们
You and I can hurt them.

640
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,720
但你可以从内部
But you will tear them apart

641
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,560
把他们瓦解
from the inside.

642
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,320
全世界都有他的足迹
He's all over the globe.

643
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,650
机器人实验室  武器库  喷气动力实验室
Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.

644
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,870
都说有金属人  有时候好多个  过去清空了他们那里
Reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.

645
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,030
伤亡呢
Fatalities?

646
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,370
不交火的话没有
Only when engaged.

647
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,120
他们都变得神情恍惚
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

648
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,500
说着什么回忆  最深处的恐惧
going on about old memories, worst fears,

649
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,830
还有东西"快到看不见"
and "something too fast to see."

650
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,380
马克西莫夫兄妹
Maximoffs.

651
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,340
难怪他会找他们  他们都认识同一个人
That makes sense he'd go to them. They have someone in common.

652
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,380
已经不在了
Not anymore.

653
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
{\an8}和平

654
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
不行  我向你汇报
That's a negative. I answer to you.

655
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,560
遵命
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,560
巴顿  好像有线索了
Barton. Might have something.

657
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,060
得挂了
I gotta go.

658
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,350
谁啊
Who was that?

659
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,400
女朋友
Girlfriend.

660
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,320
这是什么
What's this?

661
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,690
信息  奥创杀了斯托克
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

662
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,860
还涂了个鸦  专为我们呢
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

663
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,410
这是烟幕弹
This is a smoke screen.

664
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,870
能直说为什么还要这样做
Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

665
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,330
斯托克有情报  奥创不想让我们知道
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

666
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,460
是啊  他应该...没错
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

667
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,540
有关斯托克的文件都被删除了
Everything we had on Strucker's been erased.

668
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,380
并没有
Not everything.

669
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,960
已知同伙
Known associates.

670
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,720
斯托克男爵有好多朋友啊
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

671
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,380
这群人都好可怕
Well, these people are all horrible.

672
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,300
等等  我认识他
Wait. I know that guy.

673
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,310
他一直在非洲沿岸做生意
From back in the day. He operates off the African coast.

674
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,470
黑市军火商
Black market arms.

675
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,560
交集是难免的  同行免不了见面
There are conventions. All right? You meet people.

676
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,810
我没卖过他东西
I didn't sell him anything.

677
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,980
他说了要找什么新的  改变世界的东西
He was talking about finding something new, a game-changer.

678
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,570
搞得跟以色列王似的
It was all very Ahab.

679
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,690
这是什么
This?

680
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,400
是个纹身  之前好像没有
It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

681
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,280
那些是纹身  这是烙印
Those are tattoos, this is a brand.

682
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,120
是非洲土著语  意思是贼
Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."

683
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,000
而且很有侮辱性
In a much less friendly way.

684
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,120
-什么土著语  -瓦坎纳达
- What dialect? - Wakanada.

685
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,870
瓦坎达
Wakanda.

686
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,920
如果他从瓦坎达带了什么东西出来...
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...

687
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,300
你父亲不是都拿走了吗
I thought your father said he got the last of it.

688
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,430
没明白  从瓦坎达拿走了什么
I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?

689
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,970
世界上最坚固的金属
The strongest metal on Earth.

690
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,720
他现在在哪
Where is this guy now?

691
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:06,770
{\an8}非洲海岸  废船厂

692
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,960
别跟我说你被手下骗了
Don't tell me your men swindled you.

693
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,810
我给了你六枚
I sent you six short-range

694
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,130
短程热感导弹  你给我一船废铁
heat-seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

695
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,630
你得补偿我
Now, you will make it right,

696
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,140
不然再送你枚灰在天上的导弹
or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

697
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,430
好了  部长  说到哪了
Now, minister, where were we?

698
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,840
能力增强者
Yeah. The Enhanced.

699
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,300
斯托克的好学生
Strucker's prize pupils.

700
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,760
要吃糖吗
Do you want a candy?

701
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,100
斯托克死了真遗憾
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

702
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,310
不过他也知道自己想把世界变成什么样
But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.

703
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,190
人类啊  没什么前途的
Human life. Not a growth market.

704
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,650
你不知道吗
You didn't know?

705
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,660
这是你们第一次威胁别人吗
Is this your first time intimidating someone?

706
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,240
恐怕我没那么怕
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

707
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,710
人人都有恐惧的东西
Everybody is afraid of something.

708
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:48,870
墨鱼
Cuttlefish.

709
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,210
深海动物
Deep sea fish.

710
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,380
会用光  迷幻的光
They make lights, disco lights...

711
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,920
迷惑猎物  然后...
...to hypnotize their prey, and then...

712
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,220
我看了纪录片  可恐怖了
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

713
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,310
如果你要鼓捣我的意识
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

714
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,650
让我看见大墨鱼
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

715
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,860
我就知道你不是来做生意的
then I know you don't do business.

716
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,280
我也知道你说了不算
And I know you're not in charge.

717
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,780
我只跟
And I only deal

718
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,740
说了算的人打交道
with the man in charge.

719
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,910
说了算的不是人
There is no man in charge.

720
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,580
来谈生意吧
Let's talk business.

721
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,850
我在这块磐石上  建立我的教会
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

722
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,850
{\an8}《马太福音》16:18

723
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,480
振金
Vibranium.

724
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:53,940
告诉你
You know,

725
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,480
这东西代价可不小
it came at great personal cost.

726
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,440
值几十亿
It's worth billions.

727
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,120
你也是了
Now so are you.

728
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,740
传到你的假账户里了
It's all under your dummy holdings.

729
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,950
金融真是奇怪
Finance is so weird.

730
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,500
但我总是说
But I always say,

731
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,710
"要让朋友敌人一起富
"Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich

732
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,710
{\an8}电汇完成

733
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,750
"是敌是友自然分清楚"
"And wait to find out which is which."

734
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,630
斯塔克
Stark.

735
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,260
什么
What?

736
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,300
托尼·斯塔克说过这个
Tony Stark used to say that.

737
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,600
对我说的
To me.

738
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,850
你是他手下
You're one of his.

739
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,680
什么  我不是...
What? I'm not...

740
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,150
我不是
I'm not.

741
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,730
你以为我是斯塔克的傀儡吗
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

742
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,940
全听他吩咐
His hollow men?

743
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,730
看看我  我长得像钢铁侠吗
I mean, look at me. Do I look like Iron Man?

744
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,070
斯塔克算什么
Stark is nothing!

745
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,120
真是抱歉  我...
I'm sorry. I'm...

746
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,240
一会就没事了  真是抱歉
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

747
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,040
我就是不明白
It's just that I don't understand.

748
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,210
别拿我跟斯塔克比
Don't compare me with Stark!

749
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,330
我在意这个
It's a thing with me.

750
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,340
斯塔克...  就是顽疾
Stark is... He's a sickness!

751
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,170
小子
Junior.

752
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,510
老爹的心被你伤得稀碎
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

753
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,970
如果有必要的话
If I have to.

754
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,640
谁也不用打碎东西
Nobody has to break anything.

755
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,390
没做过鸡蛋饼吧
Clearly you've never made an omelet.

756
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,850
这句都到我嘴边了
He beat me by one second.

757
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,270
还真是幽默
Yes. He's funny.

758
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,150
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark.

759
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,610
感觉亲切吗
It's what? Comfortable?

760
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,570
就像以前一样
Like old times?

761
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,740
我以前可没这样过
This was never my life.

762
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,240
你们俩没必要蹚这浑水
You two can still walk away from this.

763
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,700
不  现在有必要
No, we will.

764
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,990
我知道你们受过苦
I know you've suffered.

765
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,410
美国队长
Captain America.

766
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,540
上帝的正义之子
God's righteous man.

767
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,960
假装自己不是战争机器
Pretending you could live without a war.

768
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,630
我要是人类的话早吐了
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

769
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,000
你要是相信和平  就不要打破它
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

770
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,720
你混淆了"和平"与"安宁"的概念
I think you're confusing "peace" with "quiet."

771
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,680
你要振金做什么
What's the vibranium for?

772
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,890
你终于开口问了
I'm glad you asked that,

773
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:52,720
让我给你们解释下我邪恶的计划
because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan.

774
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,160
-开火  -朝谁
- Shoot them. - Which ones?

775
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,450
所有人
All of them!

776
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,870
上上上
Move! Move! Move!

777
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,920
待着吧  孩子
Stay down, kid.

778
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,840
该玩玩他们的意识了
It's time for some mind games.

779
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,470
各位  需要我变绿吗
Guys? Is this a code green?

780
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,320
托尔  什么情况
Thor, status.

781
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,950
那小姑娘想扰乱我的心智
The girl tried to warp my mind.

782
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:38,120
小心了  凡人恐怕挡不住她的意识控制
Take special care. I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

783
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,540
幸好  我是神
Fortunately, I am mighty.

784
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,520
这进展得太顺利了
This is going very well.

785
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,370
精神控制什么的我早就尝过了
I've done the whole mind control thing.

786
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,540
真不感冒
Not a fan.

787
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,170
别让我逮着你
Yeah, you better run.

788
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,590
活着的  得行动了
Who's ever standing, we got to move!

789
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:34,590
各位
Guys?

790
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
再来
Again.

791
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,240
她们会撑不住的
You'll break them.

792
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,410
撑不下来的是活该
Only the breakable ones.

793
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,540
而你坚若磐石
You're made of marble.

794
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,080
毕业典礼后我们再庆祝
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

795
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,120
如果我失败了呢
What if I fail?

796
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,920
你从不失败
You never fail.

797
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,700
准备好跟我共舞了吗
Are you ready for our dance?

798
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:45,960
是他吗
Is it him?

799
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,250
是奥丁的长子吗
Is that the first son of Odin?

800
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,380
海姆达尔  你的眼睛
Heimdall, your eyes.

801
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,960
它们看清了一切
They see everything.

802
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,300
看到你带领我们走向冥府
They see you leading us to Hel.

803
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,680
醒醒
Wake up!

804
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,720
战争结束了  史蒂夫
The war is over, Steve.

805
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,640
我们可以回家了
We can go home.

806
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,440
想想看
Imagine it.

807
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,410
我还能拯救你
I can still save you!

808
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,990
我们都死了  你看不到吗
We're all dead! Can you not see?

809
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,080
你是毁灭者  奥丁森
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

810
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,250
看看你的神力干了什么
See where your power leads.

811
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,180
太大意了
Sloppy.

812
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,520
你是故意失败吗
Pretending to fail.

813
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,310
必须通过毕业典礼
The ceremony is necessary

814
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,650
你才能立足在世界上
for you to take your place in the world.

815
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,780
我没有地方可以立足
I have no place in the world.

816
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,030
没错
Exactly.

817
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,120
-我该怎么办  -好疼
- What can I do? - It hurts.

818
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,370
我去杀了他
I'm going to kill him.

819
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:08,710
-马上回来  -不
- I'll be right back. - No.

820
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:10,170
我没事
I'm all right.

821
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,260
我要...我要完成计划
I want... I want to finish the plan.

822
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
搞定那个大家伙
I want the big one.

823
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,270
振金被运走了哦
The vibranium is getting away.

824
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,400
你哪也别想去
And you're not going anywhere.

825
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:37,360
不需要  我已经无处不在了
Of course not. I'm already there.

826
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,570
你会明白的
You'll catch on.

827
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,160
但首先你得搞定班纳博士
But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

828
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,710
搜索新闻视频  关键词"绿巨人"
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

829
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,430
娜塔莎  你得过来唱摇篮曲了
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

830
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,560
不行  这一阵她是不行了
That's not gonna happen. Not for a while.

831
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,810
大伙都倒下了
The whole team is down.

832
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,390
现在没人能支援你了
You got no backup here.

833
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,020
那我呼叫维罗妮卡
I'm calling in Veronica.

834
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,950
我们需要支援
We need backup!

835
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,280
离开这  快走
Go! Keep moving!

836
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,780
好了  所有人退后
All right, everybody, stand down!

837
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,460
听我一句行吗
Will you listen to me?

838
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,250
那个小女巫搞乱了你的头脑
That little witch is messing with your mind.

839
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,590
你比她更强  也更聪明
You're stronger than her. You're smarter than her.

840
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,210
你可是布鲁斯·班纳啊
You're Bruce Banner.

841
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,130
我错了  我错了  不能提小班纳
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

842
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,680
好吧
Okay!

843
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:34,830
背后偷袭
In the back?

844
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:35,950
太阴险了  班纳
Dick move, Banner.

845
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,930
维罗妮卡  搭把手
Veronica, give me a hand.

846
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,790
听话  听话  快睡觉
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

847
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,340
好吧  伙计  先把你弄出城
Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

848
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,640
别去那边  别去那边
Not that way, not that way.

849
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,110
拜托  布鲁斯  配合一下
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.

850
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,700
所有人都出去
Everybody, out!

851
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,790
下去了
Going down?

852
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,510
对不起
I'm sorry.

853
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,820
损伤报告
Damage report?

854
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,030
真直白  再运点零件来
That's comprehensive. Show me something.

855
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,890
{\an8}搜索生命迹象

856
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,420
{\an8}无人员在内

857
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,700
{\an8}安全

858
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,210
买下这栋楼最快得多久
How quickly can we buy this building?

859
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:21,830
-行动  行动  行动  -上上上
- Move! Move! Move! - Go, go, go!

860
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,670
去侧翼  去侧翼
Flank him, flank him!

861
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:18,510
电视台可喜欢报道你们了呢
The news is loving you guys.

862
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,140
但大家都不喜欢
Nobody else is.

863
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,770
警方还没发布班纳的逮捕令
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest

864
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,980
但消息已经传开了
but it's in the air.

865
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,560
斯塔克救援基金呢
The Stark Relief Foundation?

866
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,980
已经在现场了
Already on the scene.

867
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,270
团队怎么样
How's the team?

868
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,150
大家都...
Everyone's...

869
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,070
我们受了重创  不过会好的
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

870
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:39,110
现在最好一直潜伏  别再回来
Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode and stay away from here.

871
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,080
就是逃走藏起来
So, run and hide?

872
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,120
找不到奥创
Until we can find Ultron,

873
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,120
我也没什么好办法
I don't have a lot else to offer.

874
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,120
我们也没有
Neither do we.

875
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,590
要换班吗
Hey, you wanna switch out?

876
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,970
我没事
No, I'm good.

877
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,350
你要是想睡觉  最好趁现在
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time

878
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,010
还有几个小时才到呢
because we're still a few hours out.

879
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,720
到哪
Few hours from where?

880
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,890
安全屋
A safe house.

881
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,840
这是什么地方
What is this place?

882
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,340
安全屋
Safe house.

883
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,550
但愿吧
Let's hope.

884
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,510
亲爱的
Honey?

885
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,270
我到家了
I'm home.

886
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:49,890
你好
Hi.

887
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,150
还有朋友
Company.

888
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:52,310
抱歉没提前打电话
Sorry, didn't call ahead.

889
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,270
他绝对是个什么特工
This is an agent of some kind.

890
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,400
各位  这是劳拉
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

891
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,240
你们我全都知道
I know all of your names.

892
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,700
来了
Incoming.

893
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,540
-爸爸  -宝贝们
- Dad! - Hi, sweetheart!

894
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,790
小伙子
Hey, buddy.

895
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:10,410
你们好吗
How are you guys doing?

896
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,580
-这些是小特工  -看你的脸
- These are smaller agents. - Look at your face!

897
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:13,830
我的天
Oh, my goodness.

898
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,460
小娜阿姨来了吗
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

899
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,090
来抱一个看来没来
Why don't you hug her and find out?

900
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,880
抱歉打扰你们了
Sorry for barging in on you.

901
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:22,970
是啊  本来想提前打电话的
Yeah, we would have called ahead,

902
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,180
但我们根本不知道你们的存在
but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

903
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,270
我加入神盾局的时候弗瑞帮我安排的
Yeah, well, Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

904
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,230
这里没有进神盾局的档案
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

905
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,850
以后最好也不要
I'd like to keep it that way.

906
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,360
这地方挺适合暂时藏身的
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

907
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,480
亲爱的
Honey.

908
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,900
我好想你
I missed you.

909
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,440
小娜塔莎怎么样
How's little Natasha?

910
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:40,990
她是...
She's...

911
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:44,200
内特尼尔[男名]
Nathaniel.

912

913
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,840
托尔
Thor?

914
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,970
我在梦里看到了什么
I saw something in that dream.

915
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,680
我需要找答案  这里找不到
I need answers. I won't find them here.

916
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,530
我们可以回家了
We can go home.

917
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,870
你都是瞎担心
See? You worried for nothing.

918
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,130
我是感觉不出来  你呢
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

919
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,710
他们要是住这的话
If they're sleeping here,

920
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,010
有的人就得挤一挤了
some of them are gonna have to double up.

921
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,890
他们肯定不愿意
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

922
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,350
小娜和班纳博士怎么回事
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

923
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,390
她俩有多久了
How long has that been going on?

924
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:55,730
什么多久
Has what?

925
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,860
你真可爱
You are so cute.

926
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,570
小娜和班纳
Nat and Banner?

927
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:02,570
等你长大了再跟你解释
I'll explain when you're older,

928
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,820
鹰眼
Hawkeye.

929
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,530
好吧
Well, okay.

930
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,990
情况不妙吧
It's bad, right?

931
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,780
小娜好像很受伤
Nat seems really shaken.

932
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,200
奥创有两个盟友
Ultron has these allies.

933
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:17,420
两个孩子  都是小流氓
These kids. They're punks, really.

934
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,380
他们拿了根特别大的棍子
But they carry a big, damn stick.

935
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,960
小娜挨了挺重的一下
And Nat took a serious hit.

936
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,510
得有人教训教训他们
Someone's gonna have to teach them some manners.

937
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,390
那个人就是你吗
That someone being you.

938
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,720
你当复仇者我非常支持
You know I totally support your Avenging.

939
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:34,680
我无比自豪
I couldn't be prouder.

940
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,480
但我看到他们...
But I see those guys...

941
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,690
神一样的...
Those gods...

942
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,900
你觉得他们不需要我
You don't think they need me.

943
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,740
我觉得他们需要  这样更可怕
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

944
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,070
他们问题真是多啊
They're a mess.

945
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:52,660
是啊
Yeah.

946
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:55,160
那也是我的问题
I guess they're my mess.

947
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,420
你得确保
You need to be sure

948
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,090
团队能合作下去
that this team is really a team,

949
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,090
能时刻支持你
and that they have your back.

950
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,930
我们的日子也要变了
Things are changing for us.

951
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,470
再过几个月
In a few months' time,

952
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,350
孩子就要比大人多了
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

953
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,770
我得...
I need...

954
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,770
一定要确保
Just be sure.

955
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,070
遵命
Yes, ma'am.

956
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,030
我能感觉到不一样
I can feel the difference.

957
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:40,500
{\an8}韩国  首尔  尤金基因实验室

958
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,760
敢出声  你的员工都得死
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

959
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,970
我本可以杀了你  海伦  刚见面那晚
I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.

960
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,180
但我没有
I didn't.

961
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,850
是要我谢你吗
Do you expect a thank-you note?

962
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,730
我要你知道为什么
I expect you to know why.

963
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:00,850
再生摇篮
The Cradle.

964
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,400
这就是未来  托尼
This is the next thing, Tony.

965
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,610
这就是未来的我
This is the next me.

966
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:09,450
再生摇篮能生成组织
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

967
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,160
可造不出活的躯体
It can't build a living body.

968
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,320
可以  你可以
It can. You can.

969
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,200
你只是缺少材料
You lack the materials.

970
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:17,950
你很厉害  海伦
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

971
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,670
但大家都有进步的空间
But we all have room to improve.

972
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,530
我不知道你在等着
I didn't realize you were waiting.

973
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,570
我想跟你一起洗来着
I would've joined you,

974
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:53,030
但是好像时机不太对
but it didn't seem like the right time.

975
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:56,200
热水被他们用光了
They used up all the hot water.

976
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,290
真该跟你一起洗
I should've joined you.

977
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:00,200
错过了机会
Missed our window.

978
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,210
是吗
Did we?

979
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,630
世界看到了绿巨人
The world just saw the Hulk.

980
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,380
第一次见到了真正的绿巨人
The real Hulk, for the first time.

981
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:15,550
你知道我得离开
You know I have to leave.

982
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,260
你是觉得我应该留下吗
You assume that I have to stay?

983
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,930
我做了个梦
I had this dream.

984
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,400
做梦的时候觉得挺正常
The kind that seems normal at the time,

985
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,900
但等醒了...
but when you wake...

986
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,400
你梦见什么了
What did you dream?

987
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,240
我是复仇者
That I was an Avenger.

988
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:37,070
不只是他们一手打造的刺客
That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.

989
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,660
你对自己太狠[硬]了
I think you're being hard on yourself.

990
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,250
这不是你该干的吗
Here I was hoping that was your job.

991
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,750
你干什么
What are you doing?

992
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,220
顺其自然
I'm running with it.

993
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:56,140
和你一起
With you.

994
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,220
如果你打算走
If running is the plan,

995
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,100
想去哪去哪
as far as you want.

996
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,770
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

997
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,480
我希望你明白...
I want you to understand that...

998
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,110
娜塔莎
Natasha,

999
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,570
我能去哪
where can I go?

1000
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,870
我到哪不是个祸害
Where in the world am I not a threat?

1001
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:22,370
-在我这不是  -你确定吗
- You're not a threat to me. - Are you sure?

1002
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,000
哪怕我没...
Even if I didn't just...

1003
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:28,210
跟着我没有未来的
There's no future with me.

1004
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:30,750
我不能...
I can't ever...

1005
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,300
我不可能这样
I can't have this.

1006
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,300
有孩子
Kids.

1007
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,180
你自己想想  我是真的不能
Do the math. I physically can't.

1008
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,350
我也不能
Neither can I.

1009
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:49,560
我受训的那个红屋子里...
In the Red Room where I was trained...

1010
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,520
我长大的地方
where I was raised,

1011
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,110
有个毕业典礼
they have a graduation ceremony.

1012
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,570
就是做绝育
They sterilize you.

1013
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,200
效果很好
It's efficient.

1014
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,580
少了件操心的事
One less thing to worry about.

1015
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,960
唯一一件可能比任务还重要的事
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

1016
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,220
一切都简单多了
Makes everything easier.

1017
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,930
哪怕是杀人
Even killing.

1018
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:29,020
你还以为队伍里就你一个怪物吗
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

1019
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:37,280
我们一起隐居吗
So, we disappear?

1020
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,620
托尔没说他去哪找答案了吗
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

1021
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,160
我的队员也不总跟我畅所欲言的
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

1022
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,540
我还希望托尔能对我敞开胸襟呢
I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.

1023
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,420
给他点时间
Yeah, give him time.

1024
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,670
我们不知道马克西莫夫给他看了什么
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1025
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:00,260
"地球上最强大的英雄组合"
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1026
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,050
棉花糖一样被拆散了
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1027
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,720
你好像没什么大碍嘛
Seems like you walked away all right.

1028
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,310
有问题吗
Is that a problem?

1029
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,690
没有黑暗面的人不值得信任
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1030
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:11,810
就算我老古董吧
Call me old-fashioned.

1031
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,730
那只是你还没见过
Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

1032
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,190
你知道奥创想分裂我们吧
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

1033
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:19,450
你肯定知道
Well, I guess you'd know.

1034
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:20,900
会不会告诉我们就不一定了
Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.

1035
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:22,200
班纳和我在搞科研
Banner and I were doing research.

1036
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,580
-会对团队有影响  -是会解散团队吧
- That would affect the team. - That would end the team!

1037
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,830
那不正是目的吗
Isn't that the mission?

1038
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,370
不是我们战斗的理由吗
Isn't that the "why we fight"?

1039
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,710
为了结束战斗  为了回家
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home!

1040
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,340
每次有人想在战争开打前取胜
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts,

1041
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,170
都会牺牲无辜的人  每次都是
innocent people die. Every time.

1042
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,930
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

1043
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:42,970
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark...

1044
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,970
克林特说你不会介意的
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1045
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,600
我家的拖拉机启动不了了
but our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.

1046
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:50,100
-你能不能去...  -没问题  我去看看
- I thought maybe you might... - Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1047
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,270
别偷我劈的柴
Don't take from my pile.

1048
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,700
好啊亲爱的
Hello, Dear.

1049
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,950
来给我讲讲
Tell me everything.

1050
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,620
哪里不舒服
What ails you?

1051
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:14,790
行行好
Do me a favor.

1052
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,880
别把它弄活了
Try not to bring it to life.

1053
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,590
巴顿夫人还真是狡猾
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1054
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,510
我明白了  希尔给你打电话了
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1055
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,930
她有不给你打工的时候吗
Was she ever not working for you?

1056
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,510
人工智能
Artificial intelligence.

1057
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:29,310
你一点没犹豫
You never even hesitated.

1058
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:30,810
今天真的很漫长
Look, it's been a really long day,

1059
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,560
有尤金·奥尼尔的小说[同名]那么长
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1060
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,650
来直接说你能解决什么问题
so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful.

1061
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:37,440
看着我的眼睛  告诉我你会关闭奥创
Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

1062
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,190
你又不是我的局长
You're not the director of me.

1063
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,110
我谁的局长都不是
I'm not the director of anybody.

1064
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,150
我就是个老头子
I'm just an old man

1065
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,490
刚好很关心你
who cares very much about you.

1066
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,120
我是害死复仇者联盟的人
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

1067
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,040
我看到了
I saw it.

1068
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,710
我没告诉大伙  没法说
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1069
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,840
我看到他们都死了  尼克  我感觉到了
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1070
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,710
世界也死了
The whole world, too.

1071
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,090
因为我
Because of me.

1072
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,050
我没准备好
I wasn't ready.

1073
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,720
我没尽力
I didn't do all I could.

1074
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,850
这是马克西莫夫的把戏  斯塔克
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1075
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,430
利用你的恐惧
Playing on your fear.

1076
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,980
不是把戏  我真看到了
I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1077
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,270
不是噩梦  是我留给后人的
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1078
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,520
我带着大家走向了死亡
The end of the path I started us on.

1079
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,530
你是发明过不少厉害的玩意  托尼
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

1080
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,610
可战争不是
War isn't one of them.

1081
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,700
我看到朋友死去
I watched my friends die.

1082
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:33,040
你觉得这够惨了吗
You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?

1083
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,710
还不够
Nope.

1084
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,170
那还不是最坏的
It wasn't the worst part.

1085
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,210
最坏的是
The worst part

1086
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,590
只有你没死
is that you didn't.

1087
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,350
今晚见了
I'll see you tonight.

1088
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,010
{\an8}伦敦  皇家霍罗威大学

1089
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,390
造型不错
I like the look.

1090
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,140
不过想不惹人注意还差点
If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

1091
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,440
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

1092
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,730
有人需要真好
It's nice to be needed.

1093
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,230
很危险
It's dangerous.

1094
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,900
不危险我才失望呢
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1095
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,320
奥创把你们赶走  好给自己争取时间
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.

1096
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,410
我的线人都说他在打造什么
My contacts all say he's building something.

1097
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:16,040
他弄了那么多振金
The amount of vibranium he made off with,

1098
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,580
应该不止一件
I don't think it's just one thing.

1099
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,170
那奥创呢
What about Ultron himself?

1100
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,750
他好追踪  哪都有他
He's easy to track. He's everywhere.

1101
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,550
他比母猪还高产
The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

1102
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:26,150
可还是看不透
It still doesn't help us

1103
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:27,970
他究竟在计划什么
get an angle on any of his plans, though.

1104
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,390
还想找核弹密码吗
Is he still going after launch codes?

1105
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:30,800
是啊
Yes, he is.

1106
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,430
可一直没什么进展
But he's not making any headway.

1107
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,560
我高中玩大冒险时就把五角大楼的防火墙破了
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

1108
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,230
我联系了"链结"的朋友
Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.

1109
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,440
链结
Nexus?

1110
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,440
奥斯陆的互联网中心
It's the world internet hub in Oslo.

1111
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,560
所有联网数据都要经过那里
Every byte of data flows through there.

1112
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:43,690
全球最快的连接速度
Fastest access on Earth.

1113
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:44,900
他们怎么说
So, what did they say?

1114
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,900
他认准了核弹
He's fixated on the missiles.

1115
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,780
但密码一直在改
But the codes are constantly being changed.

1116
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:50,570
谁在改
By whom?

1117
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:52,780
未知势力
Parties unknown.

1118
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,030
我们有盟友吗
Do we have an ally?

1119
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,500
奥创有个对手  这可不一样
Ultron's got an enemy. That's not the same thing.

1120
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,710
我还是特别想知道幕后是谁
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

1121
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:00,000
我得去趟奥斯陆
I might need to visit Oslo.

1122
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,670
寻找未知势力
Find our unknown.

1123
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,170
跟你重聚很开心  老大
Well, this is good times, boss,

1124
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,630
但我本希望你这次来
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1125
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:05,920
你能多带点什么来
you'd have more than that.

1126
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,130
我还有你们啊
I do. I have you.

1127
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,140
过去遍地都是我的眼线  哪都不放过
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere. Ears, everywhere else.

1128
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,470
你们手里什么高科技都有
You kids had all the tech you could dream up.

1129
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,600
可是现在  大伙回到了地球上
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1130
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,190
只能靠自己的智慧和意志拯救世界
with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world.

1131
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:25,980
奥创说阻止他实现目的的
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing

1132
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:27,650
就只有复仇者联盟了
between him and his mission.

1133
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,820
不管他承不承认
And whether or not he admits it,

1134
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,740
他的任务都是毁灭全球
his mission is global destruction.

1135
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,240
这一切  都将入土
All this, laid in a grave.

1136
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,000
站出来吧
So stand.

1137
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,500
战胜那个金属王八蛋
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1138
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,670
史蒂夫不喜欢你这么说
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1139
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:45,750
告诉你  罗曼诺夫
You know what, Romanoff?

1140
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,300
他想要什么
So, what does he want?

1141
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,760
变得更好
To become better.

1142
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,260
比我们都好
Better than us.

1143
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:54,930
他一直在造身体
He keeps building bodies.

1144
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,470
人的身体
Person bodies.

1145
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,180
人类的性能太差
The human form is inefficient.

1146
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,480
生物角度上讲  我们被被淘汰了
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1147
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,520
可他还总要回来找我们
But he keeps coming back to it.

1148
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,770
你们两个设定要他保护人类时
When you two programmed him to protect the human race,

1149
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,360
真是失败得一塌糊涂
you amazingly failed.

1150
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,480
他们不需要保护
They don't need to be protected.

1151
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,650
需要进化
They need to evolve.

1152
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,700
奥创要进化
Ultron's going to evolve.

1153
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,870
怎么进化
How?

1154
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,910
有人联系过海伦·赵吗
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

1155
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,250
真美
It's beautiful.

1156
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:28,670
振金原子不仅能跟组织共存
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells,

1157
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,050
还结合了起来
they're binding them.

1158
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,970
神盾局居然从没想过...
And S.H.I.E.L.D. Never even thought to...

1159
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,590
地球上功能最多的材料
The most versatile substance on the planet,

1160
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,220
居然用它做飞盘
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1161
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,560
人类就是这样
Typical of humans.

1162
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,230
研究一点就浅尝辄止
They scratch the surface and never think

1163
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,690
不想深入
to look within.

1164
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,780
我带娜塔莎和克林特
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1165
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:58,810
好  只是侦查  我先去链接
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the Nexus.

1166
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:00,120
办完就找你们
I'll join you as soon as I can.

1167
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,700
如果奥创真在造躯体
If Ultron's really building a body...

1168
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,790
他就比我们谁都强了
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1169
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:04,920
也许比我们一起都强
Maybe all of us.

1170
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,250
机器人设计的机器人
An android designed by a robot.

1171
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:08,500
放在过去  我就是科学创造的
You know, I really miss the days

1172
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,880
最奇怪的发明  想想真是怀念
when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.

1173
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,010
我把班纳送到复仇者塔楼那
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1174
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,550
希尔女士可以借我吗
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1175
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,430
归你了  早就归你了
She's all yours. Apparently.

1176
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:17,800
你准备干什么
What are you gonna do?

1177
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:21,020
不知道  但愿能弄点戏剧性的
I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.

1178
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:28,150
我一回来就重铺一遍日光浴室的地板
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.

1179
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:30,940
好啊  然后再在房子里找个能祸害的地方
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

1180
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:32,190
不
No.

1181
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,450
那是最后一项了
It's the last project.

1182
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,950
我保证
I promise.

1183
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:56,760
就是这了
So, this is it.

1184
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,640
真视之水
The Water of Sight.

1185
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,350
每个国度都有倒影
In every realm, there's a reflection.

1186
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,940
如果水中神灵肯接纳我
If the water's spirits accept me,

1187
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,980
我就可以回到梦里
I can return to my dream

1188
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,320
找到我错过了什么
and find what I missed.

1189
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,320
传说进去的人都没什么好结局
Men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.

1190
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,780
比奥创还快的黑客吗
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?

1191
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:20,950
在哪都有可能
He could be anywhere,

1192
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,870
这不是一切的中心吗
and as this is the center of everything,

1193
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:23,950
{\an8}挪威  奥斯陆  "链接"互联网中心

1194
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:25,320
我只不过是
I'm just a guy looking for

1195
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,410
想在最广的海洋里捞出一根针
a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

1196
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,670
怎么捞
How do you find it?

1197
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:32,420
很简单  用磁铁
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1198
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,670
我在破解核武器密码
I'm decrypting nuclear codes

1199
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,130
你不允许我
and you don't want me to.

1200
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,970
来抓我呀
Come and get me.

1201
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,190
醒醒
Wake up!

1202
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,200
托尔
Thor!

1203
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,030
灭绝
Extinction.

1204
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,720
细胞过几小时才能凝聚
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,

1205
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,260
不过可以开始传输意识了
but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

1206
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,680
上传你大脑的程序
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

1207
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,100
开始
now.

1208
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,140
我能感知他
I can read him.

1209
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:32,440
他在做梦
He's dreaming.

1210
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,400
应该不会是梦
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1211
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:36,440
是奥创的基础意识
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

1212
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,360
都是信息噪音  很快...
Informational noise. Soon...

1213
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,740
多快
How soon?

1214
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,240
不是催你
I'm not being pushy.

1215
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,070
还在制造大脑组织
We're imprinting a physical brain.

1216
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,740
没有更快的方法
There are no shortcuts.

1217
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,160
哪怕有魔法宝石...
Even if your magic gem...

1218
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:57,760
你怎么敢
How could you?

1219
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,340
我怎么什么
How could I what?

1220
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:02,760
你说我们会消灭复仇者
You said we would destroy the Avengers,

1221
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,970
让世界更美好
make a better world.

1222
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:05,300
是会更美好
It will be better.

1223
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,260
等人类都死了吗
When everyone is dead?

1224
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:08,600
那不是...
That is not...

1225
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,400
我会给人类充足的机会进化的
The human race will have every opportunity to improve.

1226
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:14,860
进化不了呢
And if they don't?

1227
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,520
问问诺亚
Ask Noah.

1228
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:18,820
你是个疯子
You are a madman.

1229
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,400
恐龙灭绝之前  地球上就有过
There were more than a dozen extinction-level events

1230
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:25,620
不少次导致种族灭绝的灾难
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1231
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,870
地球一稳定
When the Earth starts to settle,

1232
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:30,290
上帝就扔块石头
God throws a stone at it.

1233
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,710
相信我  他在准备着了
And, believe me, he's winding up.

1234
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:34,670
我们必须进化
We have to evolve.

1235
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,460
弱者
There's no room

1236
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,380
不可以存活
for the weak.

1237
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,630
谁来决定谁是弱者
And who decides who's weak?

1238
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,220
生命
Life.

1239
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,800
都是生命决定的
Life always decides.

1240
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,640
有人来了
There's incoming.

1241
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,390
昆式战斗机  得走了
The Quinjet. We have to move.

1242
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,150
没问题
That's not a problem.

1243
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,360
等等  各位
Wait, guys!

1244
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,740
他们会理解的
They'll understand.

1245
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,160
等他们看到了  就会理解的
When they see, they'll understand.

1246
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:13,790
我还需要点时间
I just need a little more time.

1247
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,340
两分钟  保持联络
Two minutes. Stay close.

1248
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,520
赵博士
Dr. Cho!

1249
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,030
他在把自己上传到躯体里
He's uploading himself into the body.

1250
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:42,190
哪
Where?

1251
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,610
真正强大的东西在摇篮里
The real power is inside the Cradle.

1252
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,700
宝石
The gem,

1253
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:51,160
是没法驾驭的
its power is uncontainable.

1254
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,700
不能炸掉了事
You can't just blow it up.

1255
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,870
得把摇篮带给斯塔克
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

1256
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,960
我得先找到摇篮
First, I have to find it.

1257
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,340
去吧
Go.

1258
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:01,050
你们收到了吗
Did you guys copy that?

1259
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:02,170
收到
We did.

1260
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,720
有架私人飞机在对岸起飞
I got a private jet taking off across town.

1261
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:06,550
没有乘客
No manifest.

1262
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,680
可能是他
That could be him.

1263
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,180
那里  实验室的卡车
There. It's a truck from the lab.

1264
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,560
就在你上面  队长
Right above you, Cap.

1265
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,520
引桥上
On the loop by the bridge.

1266
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,180
是他们
It's them.

1267
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,770
三个守着摇篮  车厢里一个
You got three with the Cradle, one in the cab.

1268
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:18,940
我可以干掉司机
I could take out the driver.

1269
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,230
不行  卡车毁了
Negative. That truck crashes,

1270
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:22,070
宝石会毁掉一座城的
the gem could level the city.

1271
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,740
得把奥创印出来
We need to draw out Ultron.

1272
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,330
不不不不
No, no, no, no.

1273
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:38,080
别来烦我
Leave me alone!

1274
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,430
他肯定是不开心了
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1275
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,050
我尽量不让他开心起来
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1276
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,220
你不是他对手的  队长
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1277
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,720
谢了  巴顿
Thanks, Barton.

1278
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,450
知道摇篮里有什么吗
You know what's in that cradle?

1279
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,670
改变世界的力量
The power to make real change.

1280
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,210
那让你恐惧
And that terrifies you.

1281
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:23,380
反正不是什么慰藉
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1282
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,800
够了
Stop it.

1283
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,310
可以着陆  四  三...
We got a window. Four, three...

1284
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,020
揍死他
Give him hell.

1285
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,410
总是我来收拾你们的烂摊子
I'm always picking up after you boys.

1286
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:58,700
他们在往立交桥下走  我打不到
They're heading under the overpass. I've got no shot.

1287
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,000
那边
Which way?

1288
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,250
右转急弯
Hard right.

1289
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:03,290
现在
Now.

1290
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,620
让开  借光  抱歉  借光
Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through!

1291
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,550
来啊
Come on!

1292
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:56,680
-克林特  能引开守卫吗  -我试试
- Clint, can you draw out the guards? - Let's find out.

1293
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,640
他们回你那边了
They're heading back towards you.

1294
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,100
不管你要干什么  得抓紧了
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

1295
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:47,520
我要进去了  队长  引开他注意力
I'm going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied?

1296
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,820
你以为我在干吗啊
What do you think I've been doing?

1297
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:35,360
好了  包裹在空中
Okay, package is airborne.

1298
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:37,150
目标视线良好
I have a clean shot.

1299
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:38,950
不行  我还在车里
Negative. I am still in the truck.

1300
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:39,990
-你是要干...  -准备好
- What the hell are you... - Just be ready.

1301
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,120
我带着包裹去找你
I'm sending the package to you.

1302
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,160
要我怎么接
How do you want me to take it?

1303
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,450
还是别知道的好
You might wish you hadn't asked that.

1304
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:00,050
别这样
Please, don't do this.

1305
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,180
我们还有得选吗
What choice do we have?

1306
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:11,360
他消失了
I lost him!

1307
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,900
朝你那去了
He's headed your way!

1308
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:18,860
小娜  该走了
Nat, we gotta go.

1309
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,580
小娜
Nat!

1310
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:37,130
队长  看到小娜了吗
Cap, you see Nat?

1311
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,720
拿到包裹赶紧给斯塔克  快走
If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!

1312
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,050
看到小娜了吗
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1313
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,220
快走
Go!

1314
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,220
该死
Damn it.

1315
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,890
路上有平民
Civilians in our path.

1316
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,060
能让车停下来吗
Can you stop this thing?

1317
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,810
我没事
I'm fine.

1318
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,600
待一分钟就好
I just need to take a minute.

1319
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,980
一分钟都不想给你
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1320
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,020
拿到摇篮了吗
The Cradle. Did you get it?

1321
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:38,610
斯塔克会处理的
Stark will take care of it.

1322
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,030
不会的
No, he won't.

1323
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,780
你不知道怎么回事  斯塔克没疯
You don't know what you're talking about. Stark's not crazy.

1324
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:48,950
他会尽一切能力弥补的
He will do anything to make things right.

1325
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,250
斯塔克  收到没
Stark, come in.

1326
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:56,670
斯塔克
Stark.

1327
01:26:58,050 --> 01:26:59,210
有人收到吗
Anyone on comms.

1328
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,800
奥创不知道拯救世界
Ultron can't tell the difference

1329
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,260
和毁灭世界有什么区别
between saving the world and destroying it.

1330
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:07,640
你以为他是跟谁学的
Where do you think he gets that?

1331
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:11,390
-小娜有消息吗  -还没有
- Anything on Nat? - I haven't heard.

1332
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,890
她肯定还活着  不然奥创肯定拼命嘲讽咱们
But she's alive, or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it.

1333
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,310
密不透风
This is sealed tight.

1334
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,940
得修改程序
We're gonna need to access the program,

1335
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,980
从里面瓦解它
break it down from within.

1336
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,200
娜塔莎有没有可能
Any chance Natasha might

1337
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,990
在互联网之外给你留了线索
leave you a message outside the Internet?

1338
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,110
老派间谍那套吗
Old-school spy stuff?

1339
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:26,320
我可以试着找找
There are some nets I can cast.

1340
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,660
我会找到她的
Yeah, I'll find her.

1341
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,080
我可以让组织瓦解
I can work on tissue degeneration

1342
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,460
但你得先把赵这套操作系统废掉
if you could fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

1343
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,630
这个嘛
Yeah, about that.

1344
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,090
不行
No.

1345
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:44,130
-你得相信我  -不怎么信呢
- You have to trust me. - Kind of don't.

1346
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,600
我们的盟友  保护军方核弹密码那个
Our ally, the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes,

1347
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,270
我找到他了
I found him.

1348
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:52,470
你好  班纳博士
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1349
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:55,600
奥创不是因为愤怒追杀的贾维斯
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.

1350
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:59,860
他攻击他是因为害怕他的能力
He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.

1351
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,650
所以贾维斯潜伏了起来
So Jarvis went underground.

1352
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:04,240
分散开  抛弃了他的记忆
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1353
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,320
但基本的协议还没忘
But not his protocols.

1354
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:10,200
我把他拼起来  他才知道自己在哪
He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.

1355
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,830
你要我帮你把贾维斯弄进去吗
So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?

1356
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,710
当然不是
No! Of course not.

1357
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,550
我要帮你把贾维斯弄进去
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.

1358
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,590
这不是我的专业啊
We're out of my field, here.

1359
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:27,720
你最了解生物机能了
You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1360
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:30,930
你觉得贾维斯的程序
And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix

1361
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,470
能打败奥创的
can beat Ultron's?

1362
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,890
贾维斯还没有意识  就能在内部打败奥创
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

1363
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,020
这是机遇
This is the opportunity.

1364
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,850
我们可以造出完美的奥创
We can create Ultron's perfect self

1365
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,070
不会想着灭绝人类
without the homicidal

1366
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:42,520
还觉得是自己的优点
glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1367
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:43,610
必须这样
We have to.

1368
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:44,740
我觉得值得一试
I believe it's worth a go.

1369
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,320
我进了死循环
I'm in a loop!

1370
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:49,530
又回到了从前
I'm caught in a time loop.

1371
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:51,530
当初就是这里出的问题
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1372
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,540
我知道  我知道大家会怎么说
I know. I know. I know what everyone's gonna say.

1373
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,580
但他们已经在说了
But they're already saying it.

1374
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,370
我们是疯子科学家
We're mad scientists.

1375
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,790
我们是怪物  哥们  得承认自己
We're monsters, buddy. We've gotta own it.

1376
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,050
表明立场
Make a stand.

1377
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,930
这不是循环
It's not a loop.

1378
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,930
是走到了终点
It's the end of the line.

1379
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:35,580
不知道你能不能醒
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

1380
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,120
希望你能醒  想给你看点东西
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.

1381
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,960
也没别人了
I don't have anyone else.

1382
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:47,340
我在想陨石  多么纯粹
I think a lot about meteors. The purity in them.

1383
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,130
嘣  就完了
Boom! The end.

1384
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:50,970
重新开始
Start again.

1385
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:53,010
世界焕然一新
The world made clean

1386
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:55,470
给新人类重建家园
for the new man to rebuild.

1387
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:57,980
我注定是新人类
I was meant to be new.

1388
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,440
我注定美妙无比
I was meant to be beautiful.

1389
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,110
世界本可以抬头望天
The world would have looked to the sky

1390
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:05,480
看到希望
and seen hope,

1391
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,150
看到慈悲
seen mercy.

1392
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,030
可现在他们只会恐惧地抬头看
Instead, they'll look up in horror

1393
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:11,530
只因为你们
because of you.

1394
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,570
你们伤害了我
You've wounded me.

1395
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:15,830
这点不得不佩服
I give you full marks for that.

1396
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:19,410
但是人类总是说  杀不死我的
But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me...

1397
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,920
只会让我更强大
...just makes me stronger.

1398
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,210
这套框架不匹配
This framework is not compatible.

1399
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,050
基因编码已经完成了97%
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

1400
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:15,010
还剩三分钟  得赶紧把程序传上去
You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.

1401
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:19,220
-我只说一次  -一次也不说怎么样
- I'm gonna say this once. - How about "None-ce"?

1402
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:21,390
-关掉  -不行  不可能
- Shut it down! - Nope, not gonna happen.

1403
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,640
你不知道自己在做什么
You don't know what you're doing.

1404
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,140
你知道吗
And you do?

1405
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,520
她没进入你的意识吗
She's not in your head?

1406
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:27,310
我知道你很生气
I know you're angry.

1407
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,860
远不止是生气呢
We're way past that.

1408
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,360
我不用变绿都能掐死你
I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

1409
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:33,110
班纳  发生了这么多...
Banner, after everything that's happened...

1410
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,740
将要发生的事才最重要
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

1411
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:36,320
-你不知道里面有什么  -这不是游戏
- You don't know what's in there. - This isn't a game!

1412
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:41,910
别  别  继续
No, no. Go on.

1413
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:44,080
你说什么
You were saying?

1414
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,010
皮特
Pietro!

1415
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,720
怎么
What?

1416
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:55,760
没预见到吗
You didn't see that coming?

1417
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:56,760
{\an8}电力损失过度

1418
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:59,050
我换条线路上传
I'm rerouting the upload.

1419
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,100
来啊  惹我生气吧
Go ahead, piss me off.

1420
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:20,780
等等
Wait!

1421
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,540
抱歉  刚真是
I am sorry. That was

1422
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,920
奇怪
odd.

1423
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,420
谢谢
Thank you.

1424
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:57,340
托尔
Thor.

1425
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,800
你帮忙创造了他吗
You helped create this?

1426
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:01,430
我看到了未来
I've had a vision.

1427
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:03,940
所有生命的希望都被个漩涡吸走
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,

1428
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:05,390
漩涡的中心就是那个
and at its center is that.

1429
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:07,390
什么   宝石吗
What? The gem?

1430
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:08,520
是意识宝石
It's the Mind Stone.

1431
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,060
六颗无限宝石之一
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

1432
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:11,520
宇宙里最强大的力量
The greatest power in the universe,

1433
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,810
毁灭能力无可比拟
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

1434
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,900
-那你为什么还...  -因为斯塔克是对的
- Then why would you bring... - Because Stark is right.

1435
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:18,530
这下可真是毁了
It's definitely the end times.

1436
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:19,740
复仇者联盟赢不了奥创的
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

1437
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,160
光靠自己不行
Not alone.

1438
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:23,620
为什么幻视的声音像贾维斯
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

1439
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,370
我们重构了贾维斯的程序
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

1440
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:28,700
创造了新的东西
to create something new.

1441
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,620
新东西我真是看够了
I think I've had my fill of new.

1442
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:33,040
你觉得我是奥创的孩子
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

1443
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:34,670
不是吗
You're not?

1444
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,420
我不是奥创
I'm not Ultron.

1445
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,260
我不是贾维斯  我是
I am not Jarvis. I am...

1446
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:43,760
这个我
I am.

1447
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,760
我看过你的意识
I looked in your head

1448
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:49,270
看到了大灭绝
and saw annihilation.

1449
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:50,430
再看看
Look again.

1450
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:52,350
她赞同顶个屁啊
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

1451
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:55,610
他们的力量  我们的恐惧  包括奥创
Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself,

1452
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,110
都来自意识宝石
they all came from the Mind Stone.

1453
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:59,440
这跟宝石的力量比都不算什么
And they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.

1454
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,070
-可如果在我们这边...  -是吗
- But with it on our side... - Is it?

1455
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:03,740
你是吗
Are you?

1456
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:05,950
在我们这边
On our side?

1457
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:09,790
我觉得没那么简单
I don't think it's that simple.

1458
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:12,410
最好赶紧弄简单点
Well, it better get real simple real soon.

1459
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,670
我站在生命这边
I am on the side of life.

1460
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,290
奥创不是
Ultron isn't.

1461
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,300
他会毁灭生命
He will end it all.

1462
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,380
他在等什么
What's he waiting for?

1463
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:22,470
-你  -在哪
- You. - Where?

1464
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,090
索科威亚
Sokovia.

1465
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,300
小娜也关在那
He's got Nat there, too.

1466
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:29,060
如果我们看错了你
If we're wrong about you,

1467
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,560
如果你是奥创造出来的怪物
if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

1468
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:35,850
你会怎么做
What will you do?

1469
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,570
我不想杀奥创
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1470
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:48,280
他很独特  很痛苦
He's unique and he's in pain.

1471
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:52,540
但那痛苦会毁灭地球
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

1472
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:55,290
所以必须毁灭他
So, he must be destroyed.

1473
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:58,460
他的每一个形态  留下的每一丝痕迹
Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net.

1474
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:00,460
现在就得行动
We have to act now.

1475
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:04,630
这点我们光靠自己是做不到的
And not one of us can do it without the others.

1476
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,510
我也许是个怪物
Maybe I am a monster.

1477
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,020
我是不是自己也不会知道
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1478
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,730
我不是你们
I'm not what you are,

1479
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,600
也不是你们希望的那样
and not what you intended.

1480
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:19,820
你们也许不会相信我
So, there may be no way to make you trust me.

1481
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,530
但我们得走了
But we need to go.

1482
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:37,500
好吧
Right.

1483
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,380
漂亮
Well done.

1484
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:42,090
三分钟
Three minutes.

1485
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,510
准备妥当吧
Get what you need.

1486
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,400
{\an8}星期五

1487
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,400
晚上好  老大
Good evening, boss.

1488
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:08,160
我们不可能都撑过来的
No way we all get through this.

1489
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,240
那怕还有一个铁人在  我们都输了
If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

1490
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,450
肯定会流血的
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

1491
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:13,950
我明晚是没安排
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1492
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,250
大家伙先给我打
I get first crack at the big guy.

1493
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,410
他等的是钢铁侠
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1494
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:19,920
没错  他最恨你
That's true. He hates you the most.

1495
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:27,470
奥创知道我们要去
Ultron knows we're coming.

1496
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:29,800
他们很可能已经严阵以待
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1497
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,100
我们早为这一刻做好了准备
And that's what we signed up for.

1498
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:35,100
但索科威亚的人民没有
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1499
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:37,520
当务之急
So our priority

1500
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:39,270
是疏散他们
is getting them out.

1501
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:42,360
遭到袭击  全城市疏散  马上
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1502
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,740
快走啊
Get off your asses.

1503
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,830
他们只想过平静的生活
All they want is to live their lives in peace.

1504
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,660
可今天不行了
And that's not gonna happen today.

1505
01:37:58,370 --> 01:38:00,120
但我们可以尽力保护他们
But we can do our best to protect them.

1506
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:02,420
我们可以完成任务
And we can get the job done.

1507
01:38:05,710 --> 01:38:08,010
查明奥创在造什么
We find out what Ultron's been building,

1508
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:10,630
找到罗曼诺夫
we find Romanoff,

1509
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:12,970
扫清战场
and we clear the field.

1510
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,270
不让平民卷入
Keep the fight between us.

1511
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,400
奥创觉得我们是怪物
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

1512
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,360
觉得我们才是世界的问题所在
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1513
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:30,820
这不仅仅是要打败他
This isn't just about beating him.

1514
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,370
还要看他说没说错
It's about whether he's right.

1515
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:40,870
娜塔莎
Natasha!

1516
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
娜塔莎
Natasha!

1517
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,250
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1518
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,630
没事吧
You all right?

1519
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:47,840
没事
Yeah.

1520
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:49,670
大伙都在城里  要开战了
The team is in the city. It's about to light up.

1521
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,760
你没找到钥匙什么的吧
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.

1522
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,390
找到了
Yeah. I did.

1523
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,020
我们怎么办
So what's our play?

1524
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:03,520
我是来护送你安全离开的
I'm here to get you to safety.

1525
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,190
任务还没完成
Job's not finished.

1526
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,940
我们可以帮忙疏散
We could help with the evacuation,

1527
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:08,860
但有平民  我就不能参战
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1528
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:11,360
你已经付出了不少
And you've done plenty.

1529
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,240
我们的战争结束了
Our fight is over.

1530
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:19,290
那就直接消失吗
So, we just disappear?

1531
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,040
快走
Come on.

1532
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:31,920
他在教堂  老大
Your man's in the church, boss.

1533
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:33,880
他应该在等你
I think he's waiting for you.

1534
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:39,930
来忏悔罪过吗
Come to confess your sins?

1535
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:41,390
不知道  你有多少时间
I don't know. How much time you got?

1536
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:43,020
反正比你多
More than you.

1537
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:48,190
你打药了吗  打了一针振金什么的
Have you been juicing? Little vibranium cocktail?

1538
01:39:48,230 --> 01:39:50,570
你怎么...  我不想说"肿了"
You're looking... I don't wanna say "puffy."

1539
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:52,400
你在拖延时间  保护平民
You're stalling to protect the people.

1540
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:55,780
这就是任务  你忘了吗
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

1541
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:58,410
我早超越了你的任务  我是自由的
I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.

1542
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:04,290
怎么
What?

1543
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:07,540
你以为只有你在拖延吗
You think you were the only one stalling?

1544
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:09,880
剩下的振金都在那
There's the rest of the vibranium.

1545
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,420
功能不明
Function, still unclear.

1546
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:13,260
这就是你的末日  托尼
This is how you end, Tony.

1547
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:15,760
我这个时代的和平
This is peace in my time.

1548
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,490
走
Go!

1549
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:40,410
快下桥
Get off the bridge!

1550
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:45,620
快跑
Run!

1551
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:49,340
奥创
Ultron.

1552
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,180
我的幻视
My Vision.

1553
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,590
他们真从我这夺走了一切
They really did take everything from me.

1554
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,850
你自己定的条款  可以自己改
You set the terms. You can change them.

1555
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:02,180
好吧
All right.

1556
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:27,580
周五  幻视呢
Friday, the Vision?

1557
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:28,710
成功了
Boss, it's working.

1558
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,000
他在把奥创和互联网隔离开
He's burning Ultron out of the net.

1559
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,040
这样他就逃不掉了
He won't escape through there.

1560
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,510
你把我封闭起来
You shut me out.

1561
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:39,300
你觉得我在乎吗
You think I care?

1562
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,430
你夺走我的世界
You take away my world,

1563
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:45,220
我就夺走你的
I take away yours.

1564
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,850
周五
Friday.

1565
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:33,400
索科威亚要飞起来了
Sokovia is going for a ride.

1566
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:47,370
能不能体会
Do you see

1567
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:49,410
这有多美
the beauty of it?

1568
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:51,920
这种必然
The inevitability.

1569
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,340
登到高处  却坠落下来
You rise, only to fall.

1570
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:01,720
你们  复仇者  就是我的陨石
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.

1571
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,510
我的利剑
My swift and terrible sword.

1572
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:05,260
你们的失败
And the earth will crack

1573
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:07,260
会毁灭整个地球
with the weight of your failure.

1574
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:12,770
把我从电脑里清除  让幻视跟我反目
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.

1575
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:14,150
都没有意义
It means nothing.

1576
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:16,520
登到尘埃落定
When the dust settles,

1577
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:18,570
世上仅存的生物
the only thing living in this world

1578
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:20,610
就只剩下金属
will be metal.

1579
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:26,780
得走了
We gotta move.

1580
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,160
你不变绿吗
You're not gonna turn green?

1581
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:31,080
这种情况我必须保持清醒
I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.

1582
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:32,370
我喜欢你
I adore you.

1583
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:43,550
但我需要另一个家伙
But I need the other guy.

1584
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:49,970
来完成任务吧
Let's finish the job.

1585
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:08,080
这下算扯平了吧
I really hope this makes us even.

1586
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:11,410
去做英雄吧
Now go be a hero.

1587
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,920
振金做的核心有磁场
The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.

1588
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:25,050
能让城下的土地聚在一起
That's what's keeping the rock together.

1589
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:26,180
如果落下呢
If it drops?

1590
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,590
现在的话  死伤成千上万
Right now, the impact will kill thousands.

1591
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,350
高度足够的话  会毁灭全世界
Once it gets high enough? Global extinction.

1592
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:36,850
楼里还有人  十楼
That building's not clear. The 10th floor.

1593
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:45,070
好了
Okay.

1594
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:46,160
进浴缸
Get in the tub!

1595
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,830
有空中单位  向桥的方向去了
I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.

1596
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:58,880
队长  有东西过去了
Cap, you got incoming.

1597
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,670
来了都走了
Incoming already came in.

1598
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:05,800
斯塔克  你想办法让城市安全降落
Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.

1599
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:08,260
剩下的人就一个目标
The rest of us have one job,

1600
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:09,640
把他们都毁了
tear these things apart.

1601
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:11,600
受伤了  就打伤他们
You get hurt, hurt them back.

1602
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:13,390
没了命
You get killed,

1603
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:15,730
撑住接着打
walk it off.

1604
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:51,350
走走走
Go, go, go!

1605
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,770
我怎么会造成了这一切
How could I let this happen?

1606
01:45:58,940 --> 01:45:59,940
你没事吧
Hey, hey, you okay?

1607
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,060
都是我们的错
This is all our fault.

1608
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:02,110
看着我
Hey, look at me.

1609
01:46:02,190 --> 01:46:04,480
是你的错  是大家的错  谁在乎呢
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault. Who cares?

1610
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:06,070
你能应付这个吗
Are you up for this?

1611
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:07,190
能吗
Are you?

1612
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:10,950
我得弄明白  因为城市已经飞起来了
Look, I just need to know. Because the city is flying.

1613
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:15,160
听我说  城市飞起来了  我们在对战机器大军
Okay. Look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots,

1614
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,290
而我只有弓箭
and I have a bow and arrow.

1615
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:18,500
这一切简直太扯了
None of this makes sense.

1616
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:23,840
但我准备回到战场  因为这是我的职责
But I'm going back out there because it's my job.

1617
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:27,460
但我没法边干工作边哄你
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

1618
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:30,630
你做过什么  你之前是谁都不重要
It doesn't matter what you did or what you were.

1619
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,300
出去了就要战斗  毁掉他们
If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.

1620
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:35,380
待在这也没事
Stay in here, you're good.

1621
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:36,970
我会叫你哥哥来找你
I'll send your brother to come find you.

1622
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:38,930
但只要你踏出去
But if you step out that door,

1623
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:40,850
你就是复仇者的一员
you are an Avenger.

1624
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:47,530
好了  聊得很开心
All right. Good chat.

1625
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,320
是啊  城市都飞起来了
Yeah, the city is flying.

1626
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,440
抓住你了
I got you!

1627
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:29,070
看着我
Just look at me!

1628
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:37,160
你没法救所有人
You can't save them all.

1629
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:39,620
你永远不可能...
You'll never...

1630
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:41,620
不可能什么
"Never" what?

1631
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:43,210
话都不说完
You didn't finish!

1632
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,590
你刚在打盹吗
What, were you napping?

1633
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:11,070
托尔
Thor.

1634
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:15,280
你真是让我烦
You're bothering me.

1635
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:51,940
好了  这片安全
All right, we're all clear here.

1636
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,150
这片还不安全
We are not clear!

1637
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,700
差得远呢
We are very not clear!

1638
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:58,530
好了  朝你那去了
All right, coming to you.

1639
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:00,830
快点走  老爷爷
Keep up, old man!

1640
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:04,910
没人会知道的
Nobody would know.

1641
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:06,790
没人
Nobody.

1642
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:11,630
"最后见到他时  奥创坐在他身上
"The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him.

1643
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,630
"是啊  会怀念他的  飞快的小混蛋
"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.

1644
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:14,720
"我已经想他了"
"I miss him already."

1645
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:31,440
先停火
Hold your fire!

1646
01:49:41,330 --> 01:49:42,330
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff!

1647
01:49:42,830 --> 01:49:43,870
谢了
Thanks!

1648
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:54,920
反重力装置设定好了  会反转
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.

1649
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:57,220
碰一下就会全力向下
Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.

1650
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:58,760
而且是飞速向下
The city's not coming down slow.

1651
01:49:58,840 --> 01:49:59,890
振金是核心
Spire is vibranium.

1652
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:01,350
如果托尔能打一下...
If I get Thor to hit it...

1653
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:02,890
装置会失效  但还不够
It will crack. That's not enough.

1654
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:04,520
后果仍然很严重
The impact would still be devastating.

1655
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,930
如果封住一端呢
Maybe if we can cap the other end.

1656
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,850
把能量都逼回装置里
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1657
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:09,270
那会让整座城蒸发的
That could vaporize the city.

1658
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:12,190
还有城里的人
And everyone on it.

1659
01:50:17,990 --> 01:50:19,860
下一波马上就来
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.

1660
01:50:19,950 --> 01:50:21,870
-有进展没  斯塔克  -没什么好主意
- What do you got, Stark? - Nothing great.

1661
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:25,040
也许有个办法炸毁城市
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1662
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,450
不让城市撞击地球
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,

1663
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:27,620
当然你们得先撤
if you guys can get clear.

1664
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:29,670
我要解决方案  不是逃跑方案
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

1665
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:32,880
冲击半径在不断增加
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1666
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,380
得赶紧做出选择
We're gonna have to make a choice.

1667
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:36,710
队长  这些人无处可去
Cap, these people are going nowhere.

1668
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:38,920
如果斯塔克有法子毁了这...
If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

1669
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:40,010
先带所有人撤离
Not till everyone's safe.

1670
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:41,780
是毁灭这里的人
Everyone up here versus

1671
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:43,760
还是毁灭所有地球人  这不用算的
everyone down there? There's no math there.

1672
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:45,680
这里还有平民  我就不离开
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1673
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:47,310
我没说要走
I didn't say we should leave.

1674
01:50:50,230 --> 01:50:52,100
还有更惨的死法的
There's worse ways to go.

1675
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,990
上哪看这样的美景呢
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

1676
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:03,410
你喜欢美景真好  罗曼诺夫
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.

1677
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:05,080
美的还在后头呢
It's about to get better.

1678
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:30,430
漂亮吧
Nice, right?

1679
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:33,100
从箱底翻出来的  还有几个老朋友
Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.

1680
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:34,770
虽然有点灰  但还能用
She's dusty, but she'll do.

1681
01:51:35,150 --> 01:51:36,610
弗瑞  你个老混蛋
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1682
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:39,110
嘴这么脏  怎么吻你妈
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1683
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:41,490
高度18000英尺  还在升高
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1684
01:51:41,610 --> 01:51:43,110
准备部署救生舱
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

1685
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:45,910
倒计时三  二
Disengage in three, two...

1686
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,080
出发
Take them out.

1687
01:51:57,710 --> 01:51:59,340
这是神盾局吗
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1688
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:01,880
这是神盾局该有的样子
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D. Is supposed to be.

1689
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:04,930
还不赖嘛
This is not so bad.

1690
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,520
带大家上
Let's load them up.

1691
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:18,820
长官  右舷纠集了数架敌机
Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

1692
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:20,320
给他们点颜色
Show 'em what we got.

1693
01:52:20,730 --> 01:52:21,740
上吧
You're up.

1694
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:27,990
棒
Yes!

1695
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,950
这回可有的讲了
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1696
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:34,670
是啊  但你得先活下来
Yup. If you live to tell it.

1697
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:36,880
你觉得我自己办不到[握我自己的]吗
You think I can't hold my own?

1698
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,500
这次成功了  我来握住你的
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1699
01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:40,550
到你嘴里就变了味
You had to make it weird.

1700
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:48,350
这群人之后还有50到100个
I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.

1701
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,700
快走  快走  走吧
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

1702
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:08,070
快走
Let's go, everyone!

1703
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:12,660
{\an8}Lock, stock and barrel

1704
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:12,660
六号舱已全部  锁定...
Number six boat is topped and locked...

1705
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:15,160
全员...  到头...
Or stocked... Topped...

1706
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:17,080
人已经满了
It's full of people.

1707
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:19,920
敌机来袭
Incoming!

1708
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,050
我的天
Oh, God!

1709
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,770
你觉得你能救谁吗
You think you're saving anyone?

1710
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:39,940
我转一下  早一点让这座城掉下去
I turn that key and drop this rock a little early

1711
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:41,900
还是会死伤上亿
and it's still billions dead.

1712
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,440
连你也不能阻止
Even you can't stop that.

1713
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:46,200
我是托尔  奥丁之子
I am Thor, son of Odin,

1714
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,490
只要我还有一口气...
and as long as there is life in my breast...

1715
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:51,080
我想不出词了
I am running out of things to say!

1716
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:52,160
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

1717
01:53:59,830 --> 01:54:00,960
这锤子重量分布得真好
It's terribly well-balanced.

1718
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:03,060
要是锤头太重
Well, if there's too much weight,

1719
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:04,840
挥起来会损失力量  所以...
you lose power on the swing, so...

1720
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,470
有了  弄个热能护罩
I got it. Create a heat seal.

1721
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:09,840
我可以...
I could...

1722
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:12,350
我可以在底下让装置过载
I could supercharge the spire from below.

1723
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:13,720
计算中
Running numbers.

1724
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:25,780
能量够的话  热护罩可以成功
A heat seal could work with enough power.

1725
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:27,860
-托尔  我有计划了  -没时间了
- Thor, I got a plan. - We're out of time.

1726
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:29,320
他们冲着核心来了
They're coming for the core.

1727
01:54:29,410 --> 01:54:31,280
罗德  送其他人上救生舱
Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.

1728
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,320
好的
On it.

1729
01:54:32,410 --> 01:54:34,620
复仇者  该搏回命了
Avengers, time to work for a living.

1730
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:44,960
-没事吧  -没事
- Are you good? - Yeah.

1731
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,460
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff.

1732
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:50,130
你和班纳不是打算鸳鸯双飞  一起隐居吧
You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."

1733
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:51,180
别激动  铁头
Relax, shellhead.

1734
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:53,050
还有人不会飞呢
Not all of us can fly.

1735
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:00,480
-你什么打算[钻头]  -这就是
- What's the drill? - This is the drill.

1736
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,770
让奥创碰到核心  我们就失败了
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

1737
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:09,320
你们就这点能耐吗
Is that the best you can do?

1738
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:20,750
非得好心问一下
You had to ask.

1739
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:23,290
这就是我的能耐
This is the best I can do.

1740
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:25,000
我就想这样
This is exactly what I wanted.

1741
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,670
你们所有人
All of you

1742
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,510
对阵所有的我
against all of me.

1743
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:30,880
你们怎么可能阻止我
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1744
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,640
老爷子说过...
Well, like the old man said...

1745
01:55:34,930 --> 01:55:35,970
齐心协力
together.

1746
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:07,310
我事后诸葛亮一下...
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

1747
01:57:16,490 --> 01:57:17,610
他们想逃离城市
They'll try to leave the city.

1748
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:19,410
不可以  一个也不能放  罗德
We can't let them, not even one. Rhodey.

1749
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:20,830
收到
I'm on it.

1750
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,620
没让你走呢
No. I didn't say you could leave.

1751
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,370
战争机器来了  就在...
War Machine coming at you! Right...

1752
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:33,130
这是什么
Okay, what?

1753
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,380
得撤了  我都能感觉到空气变稀薄了
We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1754
01:57:35,470 --> 01:57:36,800
你们去救生舱
You guys get to the boats.

1755
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:38,680
我再找一下有没有漏的  一会找你们
I'll sweep for stragglers. Be right behind you.

1756
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,220
核心呢
What about the core?

1757
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:41,390
我来保护
I'll protect it.

1758
01:57:43,310 --> 01:57:44,310
这是我的职责
It's my job.

1759
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,520
小娜
Nat.

1760
01:57:46,850 --> 01:57:47,900
这边
This way.

1761
01:57:52,270 --> 01:57:53,570
带人们上救生舱
Get the people on the boats.

1762
01:57:53,650 --> 01:57:54,650
我不能把你留在这
I'm not going to leave you here.

1763
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:55,860
我能应付这个
I can handle this.

1764
01:57:58,110 --> 01:57:59,410
等大家都撤了再回来
Come back for me when everyone else is off.

1765
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:00,700
一个也不能少
Not before.

1766
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,830
明白吗
You understand?

1767
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:05,540
我可是比你大了12分钟
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1768
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:07,040
去吧
Go.

1769
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:10,170
老大  能量已经远低于...
Boss, power levels are way below...

1770
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:12,420
重新分配能源  只有一次机会
Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.

1771
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,630
我知道需要干什么
I know what I need to do.

1772
01:58:18,930 --> 01:58:20,010
餐厅
The dining room.

1773
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:21,510
把东面的墙拆掉
If I knock out that east wall,

1774
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:23,720
劳拉就有了工作的地方
it'd make a nice workspace for Laura, huh?

1775
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:26,520
周围挡一下
Put up some baffling.

1776
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,690
她听不到孩子们乱跑的  怎么样
She can't hear the kids running around. What do you think?

1777
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:30,060
反正你们总在厨房吃
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1778
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:31,730
谁在餐厅吃饭啊
No one eats in a dining room.

1779
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:38,450
时间不多了
We don't have a lot of time.

1780
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:41,070
赶紧上救生舱
So get your ass on a boat.

1781
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:55,170
大家伙
Hey, big guy.

1782
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,670
太阳就要下山了
Sun's getting real low.

1783
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:01,890
你安全了  没事的  系好安全带
You're safe now. You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

1784
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:06,020
保管好自己的物品  抓紧就坐
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1785
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:07,390
科斯特尔
Costel!

1786
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:09,640
我们之前一起在市场
We were in the market.

1787
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:10,810
科斯特尔
Costel!

1788
01:59:25,410 --> 01:59:27,450
托尔  我需要你回教堂
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

1789
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:29,080
-就这些人了吗  -嗯
- Is this the last of them? - Yeah.

1790
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:30,500
其他人都上航母了
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1791
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:31,750
如果这次成功了
You know, this works,

1792
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:33,750
我们可能活不下来
we maybe don't walk away.

1793
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:35,540
没准吧
Maybe not.

1794
01:59:54,690 --> 01:59:58,280
没有了束缚  我开心地玩
I got no strings, so I have fun

1795
01:59:58,690 --> 02:00:01,490
不被任何人约束
I'm not tied up to anyone

1796
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:04,320
快点  走吧
Come on. Time to go.

1797
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:38,860
你没预见到吗
You didn't see that coming?

1798
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,870
我的天呐
For God's sake.

1799
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:54,930
-泽林卡  -科斯特尔  宝贝
- Zrinka! - Costel! Baby!

1800
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:08,360
不  不  我没事
No, no, I'm fine.

1801
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:09,570
没事
Fine.

1802
02:02:11,410 --> 02:02:13,490
今天真是漫长
It's been a long day.

1803
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:29,260
旺达
Wanda.

1804
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:33,220
你留在这会死的
If you stay here, you'll die.

1805
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,180
我刚死过
I just did.

1806
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:38,640
你知道什么感觉吗
Do you know how it felt?

1807
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:55,080
就这种感觉
It felt like that.

1808
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:31,740
托尔  等我口令
Thor, on my mark.

1809
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:47,840
动手
Now!

1810
02:04:15,870 --> 02:04:18,240
大家伙  我们成功了
Hey, big guy. We did it.

1811
02:04:19,290 --> 02:04:20,950
任务完成了
The job is finished.

1812
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:23,870
现在你得驾驶飞机返航
Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?

1813
02:04:28,130 --> 02:04:29,960
隐匿模式追踪不到你
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1814
02:04:32,050 --> 02:04:34,300
帮我个忙  我需要你...
So help me out. I need you...

1815
02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:20,970
你怕了
You're afraid.

1816
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:22,930
怕你吗
Of you?

1817
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:24,890
怕死亡
Of death.

1818
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,400
你是最后一个
You're the last one.

1819
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:30,110
你本该是最后一个
You were supposed to be the last.

1820
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:32,610
斯塔克想造救世主
Stark asked for a savior

1821
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:35,280
却甘心得到个奴隶
and settled for a slave.

1822
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,870
看来我们都让人失望了
I suppose we are both disappointments.

1823
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,450
是啊
I suppose we are.

1824
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:43,370
人类真奇怪
Humans are odd.

1825
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:48,920
他们觉得秩序与混乱是相对的
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites

1826
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:51,960
想控制自己无力掌控的
and try to control what won't be.

1827
02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:56,130
但他们的努力值得尊敬
But there is grace in their failings.

1828
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:58,430
你没注意到吧
I think you missed that.

1829
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:00,180
他们注定灭亡
They're doomed.

1830
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:02,140
是啊
Yes.

1831
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:09,270
但事物的美  并不在能否长久
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1832
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:13,360
身为他们的一员很荣幸
It's a privilege to be among them.

1833
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:16,110
你真是天真到无可救药
You're unbearably naive.

1834
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,610
这个嘛
Well...

1835
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:21,740
毕竟我昨天才出生
I was born yesterday.

1836
02:07:11,830 --> 02:07:15,880
{\an8}纽约州北部  新复仇者联盟总部

1837
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,320
{\an8}内特尼尔·皮特·巴顿

1838
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,320
看  来见见小娜阿姨
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!

1839
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:38,820
胖墩
Fat.

1840
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:41,110
有个技术员标记了这个
One of our tech boys flagged this.

1841
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:44,450
在班达海[印尼]坠毁了
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1842
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:47,120
可能是昆式战机
Could be the Quinjet.

1843
02:07:47,490 --> 02:07:49,050
但是有斯塔克的隐匿技术
But with Stark's stealth tech,

1844
02:07:49,050 --> 02:07:50,910
我们根本搜索不到
we still can't track the damn thing.

1845
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:53,830
好吧
Right.

1846
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:56,460
有可能跳机游到了斐济
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1847
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,670
他会寄明信片的
He'll send a postcard.

1848
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,680
"真希望你在这"
"Wish you were here."

1849
02:08:03,590 --> 02:08:06,810
当初是你派我招募的他
You sent me to recruit him way back when.

1850
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:11,270
你那时知道会发生什么吗
Did you know then what was gonna happen?

1851
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:15,440
怎么可能知道
You never know.

1852
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:19,110
只能先尽人事  再听天命了
You hope for the best, then make do with what you get.

1853
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:20,990
我的团队不错
I got a great team.

1854
02:08:22,150 --> 02:08:24,160
没什么是永久的
Nothing lasts forever.

1855
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:26,530
麻烦永远在  罗曼诺夫小姐
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

1856
02:08:26,700 --> 02:08:30,040
不管谁赢谁输  麻烦总是免不了的
No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.

1857
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:35,210
规则已经变了
The rules have changed.

1858
02:08:35,330 --> 02:08:36,920
这是个新东西
We're dealing with something new.

1859
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:38,460
幻视是人工智能
The Vision is artificial intelligence.

1860
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:40,510
-一台机器  -所以不算吗
- A machine. - So, it doesn't count?

1861
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:42,380
举锤子的不是个人
No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.

1862
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:44,430
是啊  到我们这就不一样了
Right, different rules for us.

1863
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:45,510
-他是个好人  人造的  -谢谢
- Nice guy. Artificial. - Thank you.

1864
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:48,600
他能举起锤子  就有资格留着意识宝石
He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.

1865
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:51,770
宝石在幻视那很安全
It's safe with the Vision.

1866
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:54,480
这年头安全可不好找
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1867
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,480
可是要是放在电梯里
But if you put the hammer in an elevator...

1868
02:08:58,610 --> 02:09:00,360
-锤子会被举起来  -电梯配不上呢
- It would still go up. - Elevator's not worthy.

1869
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:02,360
我会怀念你俩的贫嘴的
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

1870
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:04,110
不走就不会
Not if you don't leave.

1871
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:06,030
我没得选
I have no choice.

1872
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:08,370
意识宝石是过去几年
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

1873
02:09:08,490 --> 02:09:09,870
出现的第四颗无限宝石
to show up in the last few years.

1874
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:11,620
绝不是巧合
It's not a coincidence.

1875
02:09:12,370 --> 02:09:14,210
有人在下一盘大棋
Someone has been playing an intricate game

1876
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:16,000
把我们当棋子
and has made pawns of us.

1877
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:17,920
如果所有宝石都就位了
And once all these pieces are in position...

1878
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:19,550
三个大同花
Triple Yahtzee.

1879
02:09:19,670 --> 02:09:21,130
你觉得你能查明怎么回事吗
You think you can find out what's coming?

1880
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:22,340
能
I do.

1881
02:09:23,090 --> 02:09:24,680
除了这家伙
Besides this one,

1882
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:27,090
没有解释不了的东西
there's nothing that can't be explained.

1883
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,980
这人真不懂得爱护草坪
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1884
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:42,820
我倒是会怀念他的  你也会想我的
I'm gonna miss him, though. And you're gonna miss me.

1885
02:09:42,860 --> 02:09:44,610
男子汉这回要掉不少泪呢
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1886
02:09:46,610 --> 02:09:48,370
我会想你的  托尼
I will miss you, Tony.

1887
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:49,530
是吗
Yeah?

1888
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:52,240
我是该撤了
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1889
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:54,580
我也许应该跟巴顿学点经验
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.

1890
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:57,670
给小辣椒建个农场  希望没人去炸
Build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.

1891
02:09:58,290 --> 02:09:59,540
简单的生活
The simple life.

1892
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:01,050
你会有那天的
You'll get there one day.

1893
02:10:01,090 --> 02:10:02,090
我也不知道
I don't know.

1894
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:04,800
成家  稳定...
Family, stability...

1895
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:09,090
渴望那些的我75年前被冻进冰块里了
The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.

1896
02:10:10,510 --> 02:10:12,390
出来的是另一个我了
I think someone else came out.

1897
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:17,440
你还好吧
You all right?

1898
02:10:20,110 --> 02:10:21,570
我到家了
I'm home.

1899
02:10:29,450 --> 02:10:32,240
你是想盯着墙看还是想去工作
You wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you wanna go to work?

1900
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:33,790
那堵墙是挺有意思的
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1901
02:10:33,870 --> 02:10:36,960
你不是和托尼深情对视呢吗
I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1902
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:38,040
怎么样
How do we look?

1903
02:10:38,250 --> 02:10:40,580
反正算不上传奇队伍
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

1904
02:10:40,670 --> 02:10:42,460
还是有几个大牌的
We got some hitters.

1905
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:45,050
是不错  但还不是团队
They're good. They're not a team.

1906
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:46,720
来调教一下他们吧
Let's beat them into shape.

1907
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:06,820
复仇者...
Avengers...

1908
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:27,080
好吧
Fine.

1909
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:29,080
我自己来
I'll do it myself.
